# §8 — Session-Orchestration Layer (C00-class template)

**Proposal.** Append this section to a platform build's `C00-orchestration.md` (or equivalent). It is
the layer C00 §0–§7 never had: §1–§7 orchestrate **teammates inside one session**; §8 orchestrates
the **lead/session layer above them** — which account/model/effort each wave's LEAD runs on, its
context budget + succession trigger, the inter-wave write-fence, the back-channel topology, and the
pre-batched operator gates. Closes root cause **R4** (`docs/research/W0-W3_INTERVENTION_AUDIT.md` §5):
*"C00 specifies the teammate layer rigorously; the session/lead layer was improvised live."*

> **§8 ≠ Phase 0.** Phase 0 (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) is *generic teammate* orchestration; C00 §1–§7 is
> its per-build instance. §8 is the *session* layer — build-specific (which accounts, which stamp),
> so it lives in the per-build spec, not a global rule.

**Usability today.** Every field has a **manual mode** (hand-run the named command) and an
**automated mode** (the primitive that will run it). Fill §8 by hand now; it upgrades as
`docs/research/SESSION_AUTONOMY_RESEARCH.md` primitives land. Effect-verification is the rule
throughout: validate against `ps`/`git`/live telemetry, **never a config file or a status report**
(audit §7 — every config, effort file, mailbox, and `isActive` flag lies on 2.1.183).

> 🚨 **Doc-authoring rule — PANE IDS (learned the hard way, 2026-07-14).** This template, the plan, and
> every filled instance are the **copy-source** for the briefs a wave spawns. A truncated pane id written
> here propagates into every downstream brief and breaks the succession that copies it. Two shapes, and
> never a third:
>
> | Use | Write | Why |
> |---|---|---|
> | **operational** (a send target) | a **ROLE token** — `<orchestrator>`, `<wave-lead>` — resolved at SEND-TIME | panes are epoch-specific; any uuid written here is stale the moment that session recycles |
> | **historical** (a status-log fact) | the **FULL uuid**, marked as a past fact | full-but-stale fails LOUD and recoverably (mailbox fallback); **truncated fails exit 3 — unresolvable, unmailboxable** |
>
> Enforced by `scripts/pane-id-lint.sh` (an 8-char prefix is a hard error; declare a genuine
> non-pane id or an intentional counter-example with a `pane-id-lint:allow` marker). It is a grep and
> not a paragraph on purpose: the author who introduced the original truncation **knew** the full uuid.

## §8.0 — Indexing

One **row per wave**, each naming its lead-session assignment **and** intra-wave succession sub-rows
(a lead can span waves; a wave can span leads — keep both). A wave row is not cut until its **§8.8
readiness checklist** passes.

## §8.1 — E1 · Lead-session placement

| Field | Fill | Manual mode | Automated by |
|---|---|---|---|
| account | `next` / `next2` / `next3` / `next4` | `claude-accounts --rank general\|fable` | `cc-wave-plan` (axis d) |
| launcher | `claude-<account>` (`--model fable --probe` for Fable) | — | — |
| model | `claude-opus-4-8` / `claude-fable-5` | SSOT `~/.claude/model-config.yaml` | — |
| effort | `max` / `xhigh` / `high` | — | — |

**Validation (effect, not config):** after spawn, `ps -eo command | grep -- "--model\|--effort"` on
the lead's process MUST match the declared row. ⚠️ **D2 unresolved:** per-member teammate effort may
be INERT on 2.1.183 (the Agent tool forwards the *lead's* `--effort`) — so **the lead's effort sets
the whole wave**; resolve empirically with the `ps` grep on the first spawn, never trust
`settings.local.json`.

## §8.2 — E2 · Context budget + succession trigger

| Field | Fill | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `start_clean` | ≤25% | target fill when the lead begins the wave |
| `mid_soft` | ~50% | accumulate on the same task (rely on in-session knowledge) |
| `boundary_recycle` | ~60% | hand to a successor lead AT the next committed+green boundary |
| `hard_handoff` | ~73% | ceiling — fires before the ~83.5% auto-compaction trigger |

> **The thresholds are a CEILING, not the only trigger — ANTICIPATORY RECYCLE (added 2026-07-14).**
> Observed: W4 lead #2 recycled **deliberately at 49%** — well below `boundary_recycle=60` — to take a
> clean window into a 100–200K lead-serial build. *"A below-threshold boundary recycle the E2 rule
> permits but does not predict."* The rule as written is **reactive** (fill ≥ T → hand off); the real
> decision variable is **headroom vs. DEMAND**: `used_pct + projected_cost(next unit of work)` against the
> ceiling — and for a *lead-serial* build the lead's own burn (reading, editing, tool output, iteration)
> dwarfs the artifact size. On a 1M window the binding constraint is **rot, not fill** (axis g), so a lead
> facing judgment-dense work SHOULD recycle early at a green boundary even while comfortably under
> threshold. **Declare both:** the ceiling (never exceed) AND the anticipatory trigger (recycle when the
> next unit of work will not fit *comfortably*, not merely when it will not fit).

> **NEVER SPAWN AT YOUR OWN E2 BOUNDARY (added 2026-07-14 — E2 #3, `8c59b1e`, verified).** At
> `boundary_recycle`, recycle FIRST and let the **successor** spawn any pending child — do not spawn-then-
> recycle. `self-close --successor` SIGKILLs the lead's process-group children (§8.5 mechanism), so a
> just-spawned child can die with the departing lead. Observed clean: W4 lead #3 at **60%** announced a B22
> spawn; the desk paged the order-inversion; the lead **TaskStopped the spawn seconds in (zero loss)**,
> committed the brief to disk, stamped E2 #3, recycled on the rails → the **successor** spawned B22 from the
> committed brief. The order is load-bearing, not stylistic: spawn-then-recycle destroys the child;
> recycle-then-spawn is clean. (Contrast E2 #2 `63445a8` — anticipatory recycle at **49%**; E2 #3 —
> at-threshold at **60%**. Both are E2 successions; the spawn-order rule is independent of which trigger fired.)

**Window-relative % only — never fixed tokens** (47% of 1M ≠ 47% of 200K; a fixed threshold throws
away ~85% of a 1M window — audit §3b). §8 **declares** the numbers; the advisory boundary hook
(axis h) **consumes** them at `(a) committed+green ∧ (b) log-head==HEAD ∧ (c) used_pct≥threshold`,
one-shot-latched, never mid-slot. **Manual mode:** the operator/lead reads `cc-context --me` (or
`cc-context <sid>`) at each boundary and hands off when past `boundary_recycle`. On 1M windows the
binding constraint is **rot, not fill** — also hand off on repeated spec re-reads even below
threshold (axis g).

## §8.3 — E3 · Write-fence inter-wave handoff

- **Emit (wave N exit):** the departing lead bundles atomically — the batched ruling, the **stamp
  commit** that lands the ratification (e.g. `Ratified-By: operator`), the successor pane UUID, and
  the `handoff-fire.sh self-close --successor <uuid>` command (the mandatory succession statement).
- **Receive (wave N+1 entry):** `write_fence: ancestor(<priorStampSha>, integration)` — the incoming
  lead may read/plan but MUST NOT `git worktree add` / spawn teammates / write `integration` until
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <priorStampSha> integration` returns true.
- **Why:** teammates branch off `integration` at spawn; spawning before the ratification stamp lands
  makes every teammate re-litigate the just-ruled deviations off a pre-ratification base.

## §8.4 — E4 · Placement-plan source + staleness

The E1 placement is a **snapshot** of the axis-d scheduler's output (`{account, launcher, model,
effort, cap≤2/account, window-expiry-ts}`), NOT a live re-rank per spawn (`--account auto` "cannot see
tracks that haven't STARTED yet" — piles a wave onto one account). Store the **recompute predicate:**
re-run the scheduler for the *next* spawn iff (a) a model window crosses `window-expiry-ts` mid-wave,
or (b) any account crosses its headroom floor. **Manual mode:** rank once (`claude-accounts --rank`),
assign explicitly round-robin ≤2/account, re-check before each new wave.

> **E4 routing datapoints (added 2026-07-14 — desk E4 ruling; live-verified next4 Fable **92%** via `cc-board`;
> the relay's 91% was `1336049`'s commit-time snapshot — route from the LIVE read, never a doc):**
> - **No succession while child panes live.** The pane-kill hazard (§8.2/§8.5 — `self-close` SIGKILLs the
>   lead's process group) generalizes from **spawn-order to ROUTING-order**: recycling while teammates are live
>   **kills them and forfeits the quota already spent on them**, so pane-kill *dominates quota guarantees*.
>   Defer the succession decision to the **both-teammates-closed boundary**.
> - **Numeric succession rule** at that boundary: **Fable-quota ≥96% OR >2 Fable-heavy turns remaining →
>   succeed to a fresh account** (next3, confirmed fresh via a LIVE `claude-accounts --rank`).
> - **Cliff protocol** (Fable quota → 100%): **STOP + disk-truth audit + `limit-recover`** — **NEVER silently
>   down-tier the gate.** A silent Fable→Opus drop mid-verify is invisible quality degradation (the fail-loud
>   law applied to routing); a tier change must be announced + ruled, never absorbed.

## §8.5 — E5 · Back-channel topology

| Edge | Primitive | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| teammate → wave-lead | mailbox, **pull-verified** | `cc-sessions` liveness before trusting; teammate→lead is the reliable direction |
| wave-lead → orchestrator | `cc-notify <orchestrator>` (ROLE — resolve at send-time) + **R-PING armed** (`--notify-back`) | on wave-exit; pair with background `cc-await-ping`. Never a cached uuid: the role outlives the pane |
| orchestrator → wave-lead | `cc-notify` (the ONLY sanctioned send) | never raw osascript; submit-verified (exit 4 = strand) — **verifier fixed `3b12107`; it was INERT before, see below** |

Binding corrections (must land before a merge gate) go via a **durable ruling file + commit-sha ack**
(`Acked-Ruling:<id>`), fail-closed at the merge gate — never a best-effort `SendMessage` (downward
mailbox is unreliable; auto-compaction wipes a composer instruction). Prefer **respawn-at-boundary
with the ruling in the brief** over mid-stream correction.

**Directive strength — three tiers (W5 `430abb2`): a directive binds by its ENFORCEMENT LOCUS, never
by its delivery.**

| Strength | Mechanism | Binding? |
|---|---|---|
| **In-brief** | the ruling IS the teammate's task at spawn (survives auto-compaction as a file) | **Binding** |
| **Merge-gate-enforced** | `Acked-Ruling:<id>@<sha>` fails the merge CLOSED without the ack | **Binding** |
| **Mid-stream message** | `cc-notify` into a live composer | **Best-effort — even when the submit VERIFIES** |

The third tier is best-effort *even after the verifier fix* (`3b12107`) because **DELIVERY ≠ PROCESSING**:
on W5 a mid-work directive to a live teammate did not take though the submit VERIFIED — the verifier
proves the keystroke landed, not that the session acted on it (audit §7). A live session can merge its
own work without ever processing a delivered nudge. **So a correction that MUST bind goes in-brief
(respawn-at-boundary) or through the merge gate; a mid-stream message is advisory only.**

**Addressing (resolve the role at SEND-TIME; never cache a pane uuid):** role→pane indirection via a
succession-maintained roles file (`role=<pane>` rewritten on each self-close) or the newest
self-close-log `successor=` chain.

> **Why caching fails even when it "works" — the TWO succession shapes (observed 2026-07-14).**
> `handoff-fire.sh --recycle` (in-place continuation) **PRESERVES** the pane uuid; `self-close
> --successor <uuid>` **CHANGES** it. Both are "a succession" and the *role* is continuous across
> either — so **a sender cannot tell from the role whether the address survived.** A cached uuid is
> therefore right half the time and silently wrong the other half, which is worse than reliably wrong.
> This is the argument for role tokens: not "uuids go stale" (they only *sometimes* do), but **"you
> cannot know which case you are in without resolving."** Resolve at send-time, always.

> **Succession SIGKILLs the lead's PROCESS-GROUP children — the mechanism behind §8.2's "never spawn at your
> boundary" (verified 2026-07-14).** `handoff-fire.sh:946` SIGKILLs the whole process group on self-close: a
> child sharing the pgid dies with the lead; a `start_new_session`/setsid child survives (`:167-170`). Because
> the lead cannot be certain which kind it spawned, the §8.2 rule is stated **unconditionally** (recycle
> first). *The desk's field shorthand "succession kills child panes" is imprecise — only pgid-sharing children
> die — but the recycle-first ordering is safe under either outcome, so the rule needs no mechanism caveat.*

A predecessor's pane is dead post-self-close; a cached uuid sends into the void. `cc-notify`'s LOUD-on-strand (mailbox-only +
"unreachable", never false-delivered) is the effect-verified backstop when a stale address is used.

> 🚨 **Write pane UUIDs in FULL — an abbreviated id does not resolve.** Every succession brief, ruling,
> and status log MUST carry the complete uuid (`99261468-A46A-498A-AE9B-F39473E5E7AE`), never the 8-char
> prefix (`99261468`) <!-- pane-id-lint:allow: quoting the bad form to teach it --> that iTerm2's UI,
> this corpus, and human shorthand all default to. `cc-notify`
> resolves **only** {registered friendly name | FULL uuid} → a prefix hard-fails **exit 3**, and the
> friendly-name fallback does not exist yet (the session registry is EMPTY until **P8** is wired). On
> 2026-07-14 this broke a successor's *mandated first action* — the announcement that tells the
> orchestrator where the role now lives — i.e. the one send a succession cannot afford to lose. It failed
> LOUD (never false-delivered), and the recovery is a 30-second prefix-expand against `it2 session list`,
> but the failure is 100% avoidable: **full uuid, always.** (Queued fixes: teach `cc-notify` to expand a
> unique prefix — the abbreviated form is the human form, so pretending otherwise guarantees recurrence —
> and land P8 so names work at all.)

> ⚠️ **Trust boundary between the two tiers (audit §3g).** `cc-notify`'s submit-verifier was **inert for
> ~24h** (an it2 capture is binary; BSD grep needed `LC_ALL=C` to read it) — every send in every session
> reported `submit UNVERIFIED` while the ~1-in-6 composer strand went unwatched, and the orchestrator was
> quietly **hand-capturing panes after each ruling** to compensate. Fixed + effect-checked (`3b12107`), but
> the design lesson stands: **NOTIFY is best-effort and its "verification" is only as trustworthy as the
> last time you saw it FIRE.** Load-bearing rulings ride **BIND** (durable ruling file + `Acked-Ruling:`
> trailer + fail-closed merge gate), whose failure detector is **absence-of-ack** — the one signal that
> needs no verifier of its own.

## §8.6 — E6 · Gate-batching manifest

The operator **pre-signs ruling CLASSES at wave START** (formalizing "RATIFY ALL 7"). In-class →
auto-ratify + stamp (`Ratified-By: operator (pre-signed class Cn, manifest <ref>)` — auditable);
out-of-class → STOP-ASK, never silently absorbed. Pre-signable classes {C1–C5, C7}; conditional {C6
money-path = out-of-class by default, C8 next-wave-go}; **C9 `/ship` = permanent exclusion + retro
backstop.** 5-gate discriminator (`G-cite`, `G-shape`, `G-reversible`, `G-surface`, `G-manifest`;
`G-cite`/`G-surface` are un-fakeable greps). See `SESSION_AUTONOMY_RESEARCH.md` §3.4 (axis c).

> **Verify-wave findings disposition (added 2026-07-14 — `wf_b776d7c1` → ledger `6d10343`).** When an
> adversarial verify wave returns findings on an **already-CLOSED (merged) slot**, the FIX splits by class:
> **(a) respawn-to-fix on a closed slot = a ROSTER change = out-of-class = operator-only** — park as a
> wake-time override (a new teammate on a merged slot is not a pre-signed class). **(b) the in-class subset
> executes NOW under an INTEGRITY BAR:** security / data-integrity findings *on served surfaces* are
> fixed-or-proven-unreachable immediately; purely functional gaps **defer IFF they fail LOUD** (a silent
> functional gap is not deferrable). Observed: 61 findings / 49 confirmed → TIER-1/2 lead fixes now, reviewapp
> fix-branch parked for desk R-DECIDE, remainder queued post-window.

## §8.7 — E7 · Lead-session isolation

Each **concurrent LEAD session** (wave-lead, orchestrator, overlapping successor) runs on its OWN
worktree/branch — not only teammates. Never a bare `git commit` from a session sitting on another's
branch (the `dfacccd` silent-drop incident). Carry the placement carve-outs (e.g. `NEVER write
<sibling repo>`). Validation: `git worktree list` shows one distinct worktree per live lead.

## §8.8 — E8 · Session-spawn-readiness checklist (the session-layer analog of C00 §7)

Run before cutting each wave's lead — a missing box HALTS the cut (ship as
`scripts/session-spawn-readiness.sh`):

- [ ] **E3 fence cleared** — `git merge-base --is-ancestor <priorStamp> integration` = true
- [ ] **E4 placement fresh** — ranked this wave, ≤2/account, model-window not closing mid-wave
- [ ] **E2 threshold declared** — `boundary_recycle`/`hard_handoff` set for this lead
- [ ] **E5 UUIDs registered** — orchestrator + successor pane UUIDs known; R-PING armed if staggered
- [ ] **E6 manifest signed** — operator pre-signed the in-class ruling set for this wave
- [ ] **E7 worktree isolated** — this lead on its own worktree/branch
- [ ] **E1 effort verified** — `ps | grep -- --effort` matches declared (D2 arbiter)
- [ ] **Dispatch/seam completeness** — every registered stage / surface / handler names BOTH its
  implementation slot AND the slot that lands its **runtime registration** (the dispatch wiring), not
  just implementation. The **plan-layer analog of the single-owner file table**: single-owner prevents
  file-ownership gaps; this prevents runtime-registration gaps. (W4 finding, 2026-07-14: S1–S6 stage
  *runners* were built but never dispatch-registered — the stage slots closed before the dispatch
  surface existed; the gap survived spec-freeze + 4 waves, caught only at the W4 driver plate-bank,
  fixed by an operator-approved R6 +1 spawn. A registered-but-unwired surface is invisible to an
  implementation-ownership table — only a completeness sweep over the dispatch surface catches it.)

## §8.9 — E9 · Telemetry binding + self-cost

The session/supervisor reads `cc-context --me --quota` (context fill × account headroom in one read).
The orchestration layer's own footprint is bounded (shell-side = 0 model quota; injection 1:1-replaces
a human turn) **conditional on 3 guards**: one-shot latch (boundary hook), effect-verified debounce
(supervisor), timeout-no-wake (`cc-await-ping`). See `SESSION_AUTONOMY_RESEARCH.md` §3.6/§3.1 (k, a, m).
