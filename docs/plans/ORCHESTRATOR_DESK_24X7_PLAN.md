# ORCHESTRATOR DESK 24×7 — the self-originating operator program

**Scope (frozen 2026-07-18):** take the orchestrator-desk stack from "largely-activated safety
harness for human-initiated waves" (P7 verdict) to a **self-originating, 24/7, net-positive,
no-human-in-loop operator** that (a) exhaustively identifies ALL tasks toward 100.00/100.00
completion of any target repo/long-horizon goal via a durable machine-readable mission ledger,
(b) drives many parallel /handoff sessions with verified 2-way comms, graceful close, and
re-handoff at pause points, and (c) renews itself without losing the mission — while killing the
two chronic failure modes: **FM1** premature-done/purpose-loss and **FM2** idle-session standoff.
Clean and non-fragile: every fix is code-enforced at a deterministic seam (never prose-only),
RED-proven, and wired-live (capability-green ≠ active). C10 authority ceiling holds throughout:
agents build + test + hand one-action activation scripts; the operator activates.

**Evidence base:** 19-agent research wave 2026-07-18 (16 productive beats + 3 adversarial),
decomposition critic-gated. Full reports: `docs/research/desk-audit-2026-07-18/` (p01–p16,
a17–a19). Live incident I-LIVE-1 (spend-cap strand, this session) is dossier #8. Prior intent
docs remain SSOT for design law: `docs/L3-L4-AUTONOMY-ROADMAP.md`,
`docs/research/SESSION_AUTONOMY_RESEARCH.md` (7 invariants, D-A..D-G),
`docs/research/W0-W3_INTERVENTION_AUDIT.md` (Zero-HITL DoD `fea9200`, R-1..R-4 floor).

## Phase 0 — Agent Team Orchestration (MANDATORY FIRST)

**Team (6 max concurrent, worktree-isolated, ≤150-line briefs, single-owner files):**

| Teammate | Owns (single-owner) | Delivers |
|---|---|---|
| `fm1-stack` | `hooks/anti-deference-nudge.sh`, `hooks/session-continue.sh`, new `hooks/completion-assert.sh`, new `commands/wrap.md` + `scripts/wrap-ledger.sh`, `hooks/boundary-handoff.sh` | Program B (FM1 kill stack) |
| `fm2-stack` | `scripts/handoff-fire.sh`, `hooks/session-register.sh`, new `bin/desk-assert`, `scripts/handoff-disposition.sh` | Program C (FM2 kill stack) |
| `ledger` | `hooks/plan-index-update.sh`, `hooks/setup-plan-symlinks.sh`, `hooks/setup-task-symlinks.sh`, `hooks/lib/task-helpers.sh`, `scripts/find-plan.sh`, `hooks/validate-plan-structure.sh`, new `bin/cc-backlog` | Program D substrate (mission ledger) |
| `escalation` | new `bin/cc-decide`, new `scripts/gate-classify.sh`, new `bin/cc-digest`, `commands/limit-recover.md` (CC_UNATTENDED guard only) | Program E (unattended escalation) |
| `landing` | `scripts/land-lock.sh`, new `scripts/land-verify.sh`, `scripts/stranded-sweep.sh`, new `scripts/ship-land.sh`, `.claude/commands/ship.md` | Program F-land (safe auto-land) |
| `wiring-author` | `docs/activation/wiring-all.sh` (v3), `settings-templates/`, `install.sh`, new `scripts/settings-drift-assert.sh`, new `hooks/activation-watch.sh`, launchd plists (repo copies) | Program A consolidation (docs+scripts only, no live edits) |

- **Dependency graph:** `ledger` and `landing` and `wiring-author` independent (wave W-a with
  `fm1-stack`); `fm2-stack` independent (W-a); `escalation` blockedBy `ledger` (decision packets
  reference backlog items) → W-b. Lead lands serially (smallest-diff first) via project `/ship`.
- **Worktrees:** `/private/tmp/wt-<member>` off `main`; branches `feat/desk-<member>`.
- **Spawn waves:** W-a = fm1-stack + fm2-stack + ledger + landing + wiring-author (5) ·
  W-b = escalation (after ledger merges). Dispatcher/discovery (Program D phases 2-3) are a
  SECOND team cycle after W-a/W-b land — they consume the mission ledger.
- **Per-teammate:** pre-greped line ranges in briefs (from the audit reports — cite report
  file:line); "Stop on issue, message lead" verbatim; no investigate/explore language; visual
  verification n/a (all shell/hooks — bats + selftests are the gate).
- **Gates:** every new detector/hook ships with register-criteria-FIRST RED-provable bats
  (house `43de6d6` discipline) + abstention logging (`{fired|passed|abstained|failed}` to IDL).

## Design law (binding on every task — from the blueprint + this audit)

1. **Verify the EFFECT**, never the report/keystroke/spawn/config (invariant 1).
2. **Fail-loud/abstain, never fail-silent-open**; every check logs abstentions; a check that
   cannot observe what it guards is no check (blind-check law §3i).
3. **Advisory, never blocking**, for context-boundary hooks; `decision:block` one-shot-latched
   is the strongest allowed form (D-C). No blocking Stop-hook loops.
4. **Supervisor PAGES, never auto-recovers** (ruling #1); recovery runs only on succession rails.
5. **One artifact, one role** (invariant 7): deletion keys on AGE never state; views HIDE never
   DELETE; attestations bind by CONTENT.
6. **C10 ceiling**: agent never edits settings.json/launchd/live hooks in place — build + test +
   hand `~/.claude/autonomy/pending-activation/<id>-activate.sh` (durable, NOT /tmp) + rollback
   one-liner. Activation queue is absence-is-loud (activation-watch re-pages un-run items).
7. **Injection-channel law (P13):** mid-session behavioral reach = UserPromptSubmit
   `additionalContext` · PostToolUse `additionalContext` · `decision:block` reason. Stop-hook
   additionalContext is INERT. Every FM1/FM2 behavioral fix rides one of these — never
   resident-prose-only.
8. **FM1 flag predicate (P11):** `(done_assertion ∨ deference_tell) ∧ (uncommitted ∨
   unlanded_verified ∨ scope_remainder) ∧ ¬genuine_three`. Ship/land of verified net-positive
   work is NOT genuine (operator strengthening 2026-07-17).
9. **FM2 grounding triad (P11):** no state/causal claim about a session without ALL of
   {last-assistant-turn read · sessionId-resolved pane · fixed-witnessed-ref diff}.
10. **Wiring assertions:** every capability gate (comms-safety, wait-safety, never-stuck…) gains
    a LIVE-WIRING leg — GREEN requires a production caller/scheduler, not just selftests (the
    capability-green ≠ active lesson, 7 instances this audit).

## The consolidated P0 ledger (start here; each row = agent-buildable unless marked OPERATOR)

| # | Fix | From | Acceptance (RED-provable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | **gate-green producer**: project `/ship` green-gate step + commit-time green path write `git rev-parse HEAD > $(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/gate-green` | G-P1-1/G-P7-2 | boundary-handoff emits `fired` (not `abstained`) in IDL on a real ≥73% committed+green Stop; e2e fixture no longer the only writer |
| P0-2 | **/wrap as code** (`scripts/wrap-ledger.sh` + `commands/wrap.md`): ledger from live git/gate reads | G-P6-4/G-P13-2 | `/wrap` emits the CLAUDE.md ledger block from facts; readout not reconstructable from memory |
| P0-3 | **completion-assertion Stop hook**: when last text asserts ✅/complete, corroborate vs machine ledger (clean ∧ gate-green ∧ trunk..HEAD accounted ∧ scope_remainder=none) else block-once with the contradiction | G-P6-6/G-P13-1 | bats: false-✅ over dirty/red/unpushed → block naming the fact; true-✅ silent; latch+cap; fail-safe exit 0 |
| P0-4 | **anti-deference triple fix**: main-agent-scoped extraction (walk past tool_use/metadata tails) · narrow C10 carve-out (push/land NOT genuine when clean+verified) · done-assertion tells gated on remainder | G-P6-1/G-P11-1/2/3 | fixture from real 9f1c9526 turn FIRES; sidechain-tail fixture FIRES; genuine-three fixtures abstain; live `no-assistant-text` <10% |
| P0-5 | **mission-ledger index repair**: plan-index covers `docs/plans/` + `.claude-plans/`; SessionStart count truthful; `find-plan --list-open`; `status:` frontmatter schema + lint; task-list project-scoping | G-P14-1/2/4/6/7 | SessionStart reports real counts; `--list-open` enumerates every open plan cross-project; foreign-project TASKS.md impossible (fixture) |
| P0-6 | **decision queue**: `bin/cc-decide` + `~/.claude/autonomy/decisions/*.json` (P15 §3.2 schema) + `gate-classify.sh` A/B/C router (any-doubt→B/C) + anti-def genuine-3 exit auto-opens packet | G-P15-2/4 | packet survives recycle; class-B default fires at veto_deadline; C10 surface routes C; no age-reaper deletes `open` |
| P0-7 | **push delivery** OPERATOR: Pushover creds + `CC_PAGE_TO` (desk role) + supervisor plist env; agent builds the verify probe + digest push | G-P15-1/G-P10-6/G-P5-1 | a synthetic DEAD page + a class-B packet each reach the phone (effect-checked live once) |
| P0-8 | **reset-poller install + AUTOFIRE** OPERATOR (wiring-all ①); agent adds headless spawn path (tmux/`claude -p`) + monthly-spend limit class (no reset time → decision packet, never silent park) | G-P8-1/3 + I-LIVE-1 | launchctl shows poller; a parked test session auto-resumes headless; a monthly-spend event opens a class-B packet |
| P0-9 | **land-lock keying** on `--git-common-dir` + `land-verify.sh` (content-verify as code) + `ship-land.sh` extraction (lock→fetch→rebase→gate→push→verify→sweep, fail-closed) + shared-checkout refusal in code | G-P9-1/2/4 | two worktrees hash-collide (new bats, no LAND_LOCK_DIR override); red verify fails the land; shared-checkout land refused LOUD |
| P0-10 | **reboot survival** OPERATOR DECISION: LaunchDaemon conversion vs auto-login (FileVault call) vs post-login auto-resume agent; + kill self-reboot trigger (`AutomaticallyInstallMacOSUpdates=false`); agent builds the post-login resume chain + boot-delta pager | G-P10-1/G-P16-1..4 | simulated login-after-reboot resumes desk jobs + sessions with zero human action (or pages once if deferred) |
| P0-11 | **engagement verify** in handoff-fire non-recycle path: poll fired session's JSONL for a real first assistant turn / brief-text; non-zero + auto-refire-warm on miss | G-P1-2/G-P11-5 | a cold fire that never engages returns non-zero + warm refire; e2e with throttled boot |
| P0-12 | **fired-peer registration**: every handoff-fire spawn lands in cc-registry (reaper-resolvable) + reaper self-check enumerated≈live-panes | G-P3-1/G-P11-4 | fresh fired peer appears in `cc-reaper sweep` list; cc-teardown resolves it by name |

## Adversarial addendum (a17/a18/a19 + p12 integrated 2026-07-18; extends the P0 ledger)

| # | Fix | From | Acceptance (RED-provable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-13 | **Reap-safety triple**: (a) fix the ms/s unit bug in `find_successor` (`startedAt` epoch-ms vs seconds — time gate vacuous) + scope the handoff tell to SELF-handoffs; (b) "idle" requires no-assistant-record AND no-in-flight-tool (unmatched trailing tool_use / claude-child CPU); (c) pin {sid,pid,lstart} at classify-time and re-verify at teardown-time (recycle race); (d) classify reads wait-contracts + fired-peer evidence before `finished`; (e) desk-role sessions never-reap | a18 L-3/L-13, a17 S-3/S-4 | RED fixtures: co-cwd sibling no longer fakes a successor; a 12-min tool call in a clean cwd stays `active`; a recycle between classify and act aborts the reap; a desk with open wait-contracts is `owned-wait` |
| P0-14 | **Desk-existence + engagement invariant** (the missing organ — A17 capstone): launchd-side, API-budget-independent check "a registered desk session exists AND took an assistant turn ≤N min (or holds a fresh owned-wait contract); else re-prompt the stunned desk (OS-level, no model turn) / fire one from a canned brief"; includes fleet-wide transcript-tail cap/billing-error sweep + OS-level page (SO-6: the wake path must not share the API failure domain) | a17 S-0/S-1/S-12, a18 L-14/SO-6 | kill the desk (or stun it) in a probe → invariant re-engages/re-creates it ≤2 sweeps with zero human action; spend-cap text triggers the OS-level page |
| P0-15 | **Role indirection + write-only-dirs consumer**: handoff-fire writes `cc-roles/<role>` at EVERY fire/recycle/self-close; `cc-await-ping --role` follows the file; ONE sweep (supervisor tick) drains `autonomy/pages/` + `cc-announce-alarms/` + `completion-push/` → cc-notify to the desk ROLE + statusline badge | a18 SO-1/SO-5, a17 S-7/S-8/D-2 | post-recycle completion push reaches the NEW desk pane (e2e); a synthetic alarm file becomes a desk wake ≤1 sweep; zero write-only dirs remain (every record dir has a named consumer) |
| P0-16 | **Goal/continue hardening**: `handoff-fire` hard-gates /goal payloads >4000 chars (fail-loud pre-fire); session-continue gains kill-switch awareness + cap re-arm mechanics; /goal gets a durable-checklist companion file the evaluator can be pointed at (defeats tool-blindness); anti-deference fix (P0-4) adds scope-based fire using the /wrap ledger, not phrase-list-only (I-3: phrase lists train evasion) | a19 D-7/D-8/D-10/D-11/I-2/I-3 | over-cap goal refuses to fire (loud); "…and stop" wins over a stale sentinel (fixture); a false "all green" fails the checklist companion; the 6 tell-free deference closes (a19 §KQ1) all FIRE via the scope check |
| P0-17 | **Landed-by-content**: cc-classify/cc-reaper `work_landed` uses content (git cherry/patch-id vs trunk) not rev-list count (squash-land ⇒ permanent DEFER loop today); extend cc-classify:77 cap-grep to monthly-spend/billing text | a18 L-10/L-14, p11 INC-5 class | squash-landed fixture reaps (content present, count>0); monthly-spend transcript classifies rate-limited-class (parked, packet opened), not owned-wait |
| P0-18 | **Standing regression signal**: nightly launchd job runs `bats tests/` + all gate scripts + lints + `plutil -lint` and PAGES on red via P0-15's consumer (p12: nothing runs tests between lands; never-stuck regressed 21·0→19·2 unwatched); fix /ship `*.py` glob (extensionless python) | p12, G-P4-1 | a deliberately-broken detector pages by morning; never-stuck-gate red = page ≤24h |

Also folded: boundary-handoff must be registered on ALL FOUR config dirs (desk runs on
.claude-secondary which lacks it entirely — a19 live table) alongside P0-1's gate-green producer;
handoff-disposition gains a completeness axis (delegated-deliverable vs brief, a19 §4); the
compose-guard sentinel path mismatch (I-1) is fixed as part of P0-3's hook work.

**Phase 0 roster delta:** new teammate `reap-safety` (owns `bin/cc-classify`, `bin/cc-reaper`,
`bin/cc-teardown`, `scripts/reap-guard.sh`, `hooks/teammate-auto-shutdown.sh` insert-prep) —
carries P0-13/17. Spawns in W-b (after a W-a slot frees; ≤6 concurrent held). `wiring-author`
additionally owns P0-14 (desk-invariant script + plist template + activation entry) and P0-18
(nightly regression job template). `fm1-stack` picks up P0-16's hook halves; `fm2-stack` picks up
P0-15's handoff-fire role-writes; `escalation` owns the consumer sweep half of P0-15.

## Operator decision points (class-B packets at first need; none block the W-a build)

1. **Reboot posture** (P0-10): auto-login+FileVault-off vs LaunchDaemons vs manual-morning-resume.
2. **Pushover credentials** (P0-7) — one-time secret.
3. **Monthly-spend policy** (I-LIVE-1): cap raise vs cross-account overflow vs Kimi hedge key.
   Default-if-no-veto (per drive-by-default): cross-account continuation (quota-plane isolation);
   Kimi engages only on operator key.
4. **Ask-narrowing scope** (T-P15-4): sanction the ship-rail-only push allow (after U2 probe).
5. **wiring-all v3 run** — the consolidated one-shot activation (supersedes ①–⑥ backlog).
6. **Ruling-#1 scope vs the acting desk-invariant** (red-team V1): ruling #1 (2026-07-14,
   operator-ratified) says the supervisor PAGES, never auto-recovers — because naive actors keyed
   off lying signals CAUSE incidents. P0-14's desk-invariant ACTS (bounded re-prompt/respawn,
   budget ≤2/6h, OS-level channel, conservative predicates). It is built as code + plist template
   only; loading the plist IS the ratification moment (C10 already gates it). Options: (a) ratify
   the invariant as a NEW organ outside ruling #1's supervisor scope (recommended — the 11h stun
   is the empirical cost of pure-page); (b) page-only mode (`DESK_INVARIANT_ACT=0`); (c) reject.

**Sequencing law (red-team V3):** reap-safety (P0-13) MUST land before ship-land.sh is activated
for autonomous use — auto-landing creates clean+landed states that remove the accidental
dirty-tree shield which alone prevents wrongful reaps of working sessions today.

## Verification discipline

Every program carries an un-hold bar gate extended with the LIVE-WIRING leg (law #10); the
existing gates (comms/wait/reaper/never-stuck/premortem) get wiring assertions in the same pass
that wires their subjects — no gate goes green on capability alone again. Full regression =
`bats tests/` + all gate scripts + shellcheck, run inside the land lock per ship-land.sh.

  **CYCLE 3: COMPLETENESS RECONCILIATION + TWO LINCHPIN SAFETY FIXES landed; agent-buildable remainder
  enumerated into the mission ledger; operator go-live surfaced.** Method: a 7-agent read-only audit wave
  (one per Program A/B/C/D+E/F + adversarial P0-13..18 + the activation/wiring boundary) verified EVERY
  task ID against HEAD, not the status-log's self-report — plus the full `bats tests/` = **629/629 green**
  ground-truth. Corpus: `docs/research/desk-audit-2026-07-18/` + the lead's synthesis. **What the audit
  found (the honest map):**
  - The **P0-ledger core (P0-1..18) + Cycle-2 spine is genuinely built, RED-proven, landed, and the
    desk-existence organs are LOADED LIVE** (`com.claude.desk-invariant`, `com.claude.nightly-regression`,
    `com.chrisren.autonomy-sweep`, `com.chrisren.cc-reaper`, `com.claude.lead-supervisor`, `com.reso.lr-reset-poller`
    — the last FIRED in prod 2026-07-19). Hooks (completion-assert/anti-deference/session-continue/dod-persist/
    boundary-handoff/activation-watch) live + uniform across all config dirs.
  - **FALSE already-landed premises (corrected):** (1) **P0-1 gate-green producer was NOT built** — `ship-land.sh`
    never wrote `gate-green`; the only writers were test fixtures, so `boundary-handoff.sh:122` abstained 100%
    in prod (FM1(b) advisory inert). The "landing … pipeline w/ gate-green producer" claim above was false.
    (2) **P0-14 dead-desk RESPAWN was broken in prod** — `desk-invariant.sh fire_replacement` omitted the
    `--prompt-file` that `handoff-fire.sh:617` requires (rode an unconsumed `DESK_BOOT_BRIEF`), so a fully-dead
    desk exited 1 and was NEVER recreated (a17's #1 "nothing can CREATE a desk" organ, silently broken; its
    selftest masked it by stubbing `FIRE_BIN` accept-anything). STUNNED/STALE re-prompt + spend-cap OS-page
    (the 11h-stun incident) DO work and are live — only the fully-dead respawn sub-path was broken.
  - **Program-*ladder* over-claim:** "W-a/W-b COMPLETE" is accurate only for the P0-ledger rows; the P1/P2
    ladder items (T-P*/G-P*) were largely NEVER assigned to a teammate and remain unbuilt (dark capabilities:
    every safety capability — deathwatch/reconciler/wait-contract-lint/never-stuck/completion-push F5/payload-lint
    F3/exit-deadline F4 — is built + bats-green but the live `lead-supervisor.sh sweep()` invokes NONE).
  - **Two plan-mandated STAGING gaps:** `~/.claude/autonomy/pending-activation/` was ABSENT → `activation-watch`
    (wired live, all dirs) was INERT (watches a missing dir); and `wiring-all.sh`'s symlink list was stale vs
    Cycle-2 (missed cc-wave-plan/dispatch/discover).

  **THIS session landed (branch `feat/desk-24x7-finalize`, RED-first, single 629+2-bats gate, via ship-land):**
  `27d9ed1` P0-14 dead-desk respawn (pass `--prompt-file "$BRIEF"`; masking accept-anything stub → contract-faithful,
  RED-proven) · `cc9348c` P0-1 gate-green producer (write HEAD→gate-green after `run_gate` passes, both --dry-run
  + push paths; RED-proven absent-before/==HEAD-after/never-red) · `645186a` wiring-all Cycle-2 symlink
  refresh · plan reconciliation (this entry + the inline P0-1 correction). Plus (non-repo, plan law #6): the
  **pending-activation queue POPULATED** with the outstanding C10 operator steps as durable one-action scripts +
  rollback (activation-watch is now a live absence-is-loud net), and the **full agent-buildable remainder
  ENUMERATED into cc-backlog** (the plan's own Program-D discovery function, done by hand since the discovery
  plist is unloaded).

  **OPERATOR go-live sequence (C10 — agent staged, operator runs; a class-B decision packet + desk notify were
  opened):** (1) **reap-guard insert into live `teammate-auto-shutdown.sh` FIRST** (sequencing lynchpin — must
  precede any autonomous ship-land, else the dirty-tree shield is removed while reap-guard is dormant = wrongful-reap
  window) → (2) load `com.claude.dispatcher` + `com.claude.discovery` plists (the autonomous-operator go-live
  ratification, operator decisions #5/#6) → (3) arm the phone page channel (`PUSHOVER_TOKEN/USER` + `CC_PAGE_TO=desk`
  — currently dead-letter, P0-7 decision #2). Open operator decisions unchanged: #1 reboot posture, #3 monthly-spend
  policy, #4 ask-narrowing sanction.

  **Agent-buildable remainder (→ cc-backlog for future desk waves; NONE are C10):** P0-14-adjacent none; the reboot
  agent-half (P0-10 resume chain + boot-delta pager), P0-7/P0-8 agent halves (delivery-verify probe, headless resume,
  killed-session monthly-spend packet), the net-positive value ledger (T-P14-7/T-P8-5 — the program's own goal),

  never edits the live daemon") — surfaced, not auto-built.
  **Learnings:** (1) the audit vindicated the "already-landed premises are the #1 audit dimension" rule — 2 of the
  program's highest-value P0 items (P0-1, P0-14) were false-landed/broken-in-prod behind green selftests that
  MASKED the gap (accept-anything stubs). Never trust a status-log "landed"; grep HEAD + demand a contract-faithful
  RED test. (2) "capability-green ≠ active" held 3rd/4th time: dark capabilities + an inert activation-watch (empty
  queue) + an unconsumed env var were all green-at-the-unit yet dead-in-prod. (3) Cycle-3 scope was deliberately
  bounded to lead-buildable linchpins + staging + honest enumeration; the mechanical ladder remainder is fed to the
  mission ledger for the dispatcher's future waves rather than hand-built in one session (respects the desk's own
  iterative-wave architecture + the scope-freeze discipline).

- 2026-07-19 — **T-P15-4 ship-rail scoped-allow push hook BUILT (agent half; C10 activation staged for the
  operator).** `hooks/ship-rail-push-allow.sh` is a PreToolUse(Bash) hook that auto-allows exactly the
  non-force land shape `git push origin HEAD:<branch>` and defers everything else (force / other-remote /
  bare push / compound / substitution → the `git push:*` ask + the force `deny` rules stay in force). Mirrors
  `rm-safe-allowlist` (allow is opt-in to ONE shape). `tests/ship-rail-push-allow.bats` 8/8 green + shellcheck
  clean; landed via ship-land. Activation is **C10 / operator decision #4**:
  `docs/SHIP-RAIL-PUSH-ALLOW-ACTIVATION.md` + idempotent `docs/activation/ship-rail-push-activate.sh` (dry-run
  validated against all 5 live `settings.json`; the agent NEVER edits `settings.json` in place).
  **U2 RESOLVED** (the audit's open uncertainty): the infra rail did NOT strand because `ship-land.sh:186`
  pushes as a **subprocess** (a non-Bash-tool path, already ask-exempt — recent `tool:ship-land` `land.log`
  entries exit 0 unattended). The real strand is the **model-issued** land push (`commands/ship.md:43`), which
  this hook covers; it is the complement of `smart-bash-allowlist.sh`, which allows feature-branch pushes but
  DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES trunk. The remainder-list line above (T-P15-4) is now built, pending operator activation.
- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `59e9fdf1132c`) — **T-P11-6
  desk-assert LIVE WIRING landed** (branch `feat/desk-assert-live-wiring`, RED-first, via project
  `/ship`). `bin/desk-assert` (the law-#9 grounding-triad guard, `a103e7f`) shipped selftest-only — the
  textbook "capability-green ≠ active" gap (law #10): PATH-installed via `wiring-all.sh`'s symlink loop
  but with NO production caller. Closed by upgrading the RESIDENT DESK RULE the LIVE `desk-invariant`
  daemon fires from (`docs/templates/desk-boot-brief.md:25`, per `desk-invariant.sh:48`) from prose
  ("keep two-way comms grounded (FM2 triad…)") into an EXECUTABLE rule that RUNS
  `desk-assert <sid> [--witnessed-ref <ref>]` before any state/causal claim about another session, with
  `UNGROUNDED`(exit 1) = claim-not-earned (read transcript / resolve pane via `cc-sessions --json` /
  pin the witnessed ref, then re-run). Made non-regressible by a RED-provable wiring gate
  (`tests/desk-assert-wiring.bats`, 8 checks: INSTALL-on-PATH · GUARD-invocable · the RESIDENT-RULE
  legs that the brief INVOKES the guard inside the law-#9 context — strip the invocation back to prose
  and 4 legs go red, proven this session). Full `bats tests/` **715/715 green**.
  **Scope discipline (why this is the whole item, and non-C10):** the desk's AUTOMATED state-claim path
  (`cc-classify`) already embodies the triad IN CODE (leg-1 `last_assistant_ts` excludes sidechain/
  api-error, leg-2 pane resolution, never mtime) → NOT touched; `lead-supervisor` is the
  operator-sanctioned live daemon (`wiring-all.sh:151` "the agent never edits the live daemon") → NOT
  touched; a NEW settings.json hook would be a C10 activation → avoided (this item is "NONE are C10").
  The residual FM2 gap was exactly p11's INC-1/2/3: the IN-SESSION desk making ad-hoc ungrounded claims
  where the rule was prose-only — now an executable check the desk runs. **Learning:** desk-assert's own
  header already called itself "the house rule made executable"; the missing half was a resident rule
  that INVOKES it + a gate that fails if that invocation ever regresses to a name-drop.
- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `99beeafd7774`) — **T-P8-6
  cliff→kimi offer/route landed** (branch `feat/cliff-kimi-offer`, RED-first, via project `/ship`).
  Closes G-P8-5's machinery half: a full-Anthropic cap (every Max account capped = the true `cc-route`
  QUOTA CLIFF) had **zero overflow capacity** because the metered Kimi hedge could only engage by a
  human remembering it. Now the cliff branch (`bin/cc-route` `general_stop`) runs a new silent gate
  `claude-kimi wired` (`bin/claude-kimi` `_cmd_wired` — exit 0 iff a key resolves, via the SAME
  `_resolve_key` authority; no output) and, **only when WIRED**, OFFERS Kimi overflow on the *same
  exit-4 STOP* (stderr: `claude-kimi` alongside `/limit-recover`; record `cliff-kimi-offer`); not
  wired → the unchanged plain STOP + a `claude-kimi set-key` enablement hint. Doc surface upgraded in
  `commands/limit-recover.md` (the "Kimi engages only on an operator key" line → the wired-gated
  offer). **Design decision (why OFFER, not the audit's looser "auto-select"):** a cliff is a STOP —
  `cc-route` never emits a spawn plan for, nor silent-down-tiers to, a *metered paid endpoint*; the
  exit-4 / empty-stdout RT-c contract is preserved byte-for-byte (all prior RT-c tests stay green),
  WIRED changes only the STOP's stderr guidance + the audit record. Ratifies the plan's own line-123
  wording ("cliff-fallback **offer**") over p08's "offer/auto-select"; a standing-authorization
  auto-fire, if ever wanted, is T-P8-3's autonomy policy, not this always-a-STOP branch. **Gate:**
  `cc-route selftest` 15→**19** (new RT-g: WIRED still-exit-4 · no-plan+offers-claude-kimi ·
  records-cliff-kimi-offer · UNwired-no-leak), `claude-kimi selftest` 12→**14** (ST-h wired gate),
  `bats tests/cc-route.bats`+`claude-kimi.bats` count-pinned + CLI offer/gate regressions, `shellcheck`
  clean, `route-safety-gate.sh` green. **The DoD's other half is the OPERATOR's:** `claude-kimi status`
  = WIRED needs `claude-kimi set-key` (the metered key = the operator's spend, plan §E line-123
  "OPERATOR key") — the machinery is complete + gate-green and correctly abstains until then. **Learning:**
  the offer-vs-auto-route fork is the load-bearing scope call — the safe, contract-preserving choice was
  to keep the cliff a STOP and let WIRED change only what it *says*, so no existing invariant (never
  fire blind / never silent down-tier / exit-4 no-plan) bends to accommodate the hedge.
- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `4de57082de3d`) — **T-P7-7
  gate-batching manifest C1..C10 + auto-stamp trailer BUILT + landed** (branch `feat/desk-gate-batching`,
  RED-first, via project `/ship`). Closes the axis-c remainder of G-P7-8: `gate-classify.sh` (P3
  surface router) + `cc-bind` (per-ruling content ack) + `cc-decide` (the class-B packet queue) already
  existed; the missing legs were the **class pre-signing manifest** and its **auto-stamp/backstop**.
  `scripts/gate-manifest.sh` delivers **P1 registry** (the C1..C10 signability map is data in the
  script header + `classes`: {C1-C5,C7} pre-signable · {C6 money, C8 next-wave-go} conditional/
  out-of-class-by-default · {C9 /ship, C10 self-mod} PERMANENT exclusion), **P2 sign** (`sign --wave
  --classes --expiry` writes `~/.claude/autonomy/gate-manifest/<wave>.json`; REFUSES C9/C10 LOUD even
  with `--allow-conditional`, REFUSES C6/C8 without it — the gate-classify asymmetry mirrored),
  **P4 check + auto-stamp** (`check` = the G-manifest gate, FAIL-CLOSED like cc-bind's one-invariant:
  no-manifest / expired / out-of-class all exit 1 LOUD, never a silent pass; `stamp` prints
  `Ratified-By: operator (pre-signed class Cn, manifest <wave>@<expiry>)` only when in-class),
  **P7 per-wave expiry** (a stale manifest ⇒ all out-of-class; ISO-8601-Z lexical compare, `CC_NOW`
  test-overridable), and **P6 `/ship` backstop** (`gate-manifest.sh backstop <range>` = `git log
  --grep 'pre-signed class C<n>'` surfacing auto-ratifications for EARLY-VETO, NON-BLOCKING by
  contract; the `C<n>` digit pins the grep to the stamp TRAILER, not a prose mention).
  Wired into `scripts/ship-land.sh` preflight (the dual of `esc_scan`: esc_scan PARKS out-of-class
  surfaces, the backstop only SURFACES in-class auto-ratifications) + documented in
  `.claude/commands/ship.md`. Gate: `tests/gate-manifest.bats` **33/33** (register-criteria-first;
  the P6 grep-key `pre-signed class C<n>` is a pinned invariant so P4-stamp and P6-grep can never
  drift, and the digit blocks prose-mention false-positives) + full `bats tests/` **814/814** +
  shellcheck clean; the backstop was **effect-verified end-to-end** through
  a real `ship-land.sh --dry-run` (hermetic origin, stamped commit surfaced, land stayed green).
  **Scope discipline (non-C10):** `gate-manifest sign` writes a DATA file under `autonomy/` (like
  `cc-decide`), NOT settings/hooks/launchd — building + running it is within the ceiling; the operator
  SIGNS manifests at wave start (a runtime action), the agent only builds the mechanism. **Learning:**
  co-locating the P4 stamp-writer and the P6 grep-reader in ONE file (with a bats-pinned shared key)
  is what makes the "auto-stamp ledger + /ship retro-review" pair non-regressible — a split would let
  the trailer text and the backstop grep silently diverge.
- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `25c1dc96551c`) — **T-P9-7
  ship-land auto-rollback + bounded retry on verify-fail landed** (`ad73469`, branch
  `feat/ship-land-auto-rollback`, RED-first, via project `/ship`). The post-push content-verify (the
  2026-07-11 concurrent-drop guard) previously exited 8 and stranded the operator on MANUAL recovery. Now
  `scripts/ship-land.sh` auto-reconciles onto the moved trunk (re-fetch + rebase + re-gate + re-push) up to
  `SHIP_LAND_VERIFY_RETRIES` times (default 2; `=0` = the pre-T-P9-7 single-shot kill switch). Fail-closed +
  bounded: a **transient** concurrent drop now SELF-HEALS (the re-push sticks → exit 0); an auto-retry rebase
  **conflict** rolls back (`git rebase --abort`, never a wedged tree) → exit 5; retries **exhausted** → a
  guaranteed-clean committed tree with the `ship/backup-*` ref intact → exit 8. **Scope discipline:** the
  retry is triggered ONLY by a verify-fail — the FIRST push keeps its exit-7 (no retry), so the pre-existing
  non-ff semantics and its test are untouched. `tests/ship-land.bats` 14/14 (3 new + 1 augmented),
  **anti-tautology-proven**: recover→exit-0, conflict→exit-5, and the exhaustion retry-evidence assertion all
  go RED against the pre-change script, while the `=0` kill-switch stays green on both (the back-compat guard).
  Full `bats tests/` 821 green + shellcheck clean; content-verified on land (`land.log` exit 0, hold 309s).
  **Non-C10** (script + tests + docs only; no `settings.json` / live-hook / launchd edit). **Learning:** the
  audit doc's line-141 "T-P9-7" (push-permission intent) is a STALE label collision — that meaning was built
  as T-P15-4; the backlog item (source `desk-audit-2026-07-19`) is unambiguously the auto-rollback task. Grep
  the backlog ID's own title, never a same-numbered audit row.
- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `846380c6308f` under umbrella
  `e1624e88cac1`) — **shared-gate de-flake: the `cc-run` selftest Test B heartbeat-freshness load-flake
  KILLED** (branch `feat/desk-ccrun-flake`, RED-first, via `ship-land` — full `bats tests/` **818/818**,
  content-verified, landed `69f6426`). `cc-run selftest` Test B proved output-keyed freshness with an
  **absolute age-at-check** (`now − mtime < 1`) that straddles integer-second boundaries under
  concurrent-suite load → Test B fails → `n_ok=3` → `tests/cc-run.bats:12` reds the **shared `ship-land`
  gate ~1/3 under load, blocking EVERY desk session's land** (filed during T-P15-7 landing). Fixed with a
  **start-relative delta** (`beat mtime − command-start t0 ≥ 1`), invariant to check-delay; a
  `CC_RUN_SELFTEST_CHECK_DELAY` seam (default 0 → no behavior change) injects the delay so the guard is
  **RED-provable** (old logic + `=2` → `age 2s wanted <1`, `n_ok=3`, exit 1; new logic → green under
  2s/5s + 5× repeats) + a bats regression pins it. **Learning:** `3b71718` had already fixed the
  IDENTICAL pattern on the standalone L3-b *bats* test but left a SECOND copy of it inside `bin/cc-run`'s
  own `selftest` — a fix applied to ONE instance of a defect CLASS while a sibling copy survives (sweep
  classes, not instances). De-flaking a timing assertion ⇒ grep every copy of the `age_of`/absolute-age
  idiom. **Discovery filed** (`179006d15e09`): `tests/handoff-fire-completion-push.bats:51`
  (`--successor <dead pane>` liveness gate) is a SEPARATE load-sensitive shared-gate flake — failed once
  in the full suite under load, passes in isolation → new mission-ledger item for a future wave (not this scope).

- 2026-07-19 (desk peer session, Opus@max, /goal-driven — cc-backlog `ae0025d4bacc`) — **Part B1
  permission auto-allow hook wiring PROPOSED (C10 operator-gated).** Resolves the desk-audit latent gap
  (`desk-anti-hitl-2026-07-19.md:30`): the two committed allow-hooks referenced in **zero** `settings.json`
  (re-grepped this session — `ship-rail=0 smart-bash=0` in all 5 dirs; both are symlinked-but-unregistered
  via `install.sh:89-91`). **Verdict: WIRE `ship-rail-push-allow.sh`, KEEP INERT `smart-bash-allowlist.sh`.**
  Ship-rail's activator already exists (`docs/activation/ship-rail-push-activate.sh`, `9d2bf16`,
  Operator decision #4) — re-validated this session against a scratchpad **copy** of live
  `~/.claude/settings.json` (jq transform valid, appends as an additional Bash hook, everything outside
  `.hooks.PreToolUse` byte-identical; live files never touched — C10). Smart-bash is **not armed**, mirroring
  the rm-safe precedent (`L3-L4-AUTONOMY-ROADMAP.md:82-86`: "scoped a NEW rm-only hook instead of activating
  the broader one … allow is opt-in to a whitelist, never opt-out"): it is a pattern-matcher over
  worker-authored command strings (the Part B thesis's forbidden weak boundary, `:4`) and carries concrete
  fail-open defects (its `sed`/`chmod` `(?!…)` absolute-path guards are invalid ERE → `grep -qE` errors →
  the reject branch never fires → `sed -i … /etc/hosts` would slip; reso-hardcoded deny lists; last-token-only
  `sed` target). Each smart-bash shape maps to a scoped hook (`rm`→`rm-safe-allowlist` live; land-push→`ship-rail`;
  the rest → new tight hooks *iff* a strand is observed) — never the broad one. Full proposal +
  operator runbook: `docs/PART-B1-PERMISSION-HOOK-WIRING.md`. No `--apply` shipped for smart-bash by design.
