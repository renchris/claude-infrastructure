# Two-Way Session Comms — Implementation Plan

> **v2 (2026-07-20) — eliminate keystroke injection.** The v1 feature below is landed and works, but its
> transport is the problem v2 fixes: every delivery (`cc-notify`, reaper surface, supervisor page,
> `--notify-back`, `cc-announce`) lands via **it2 keystroke injection** into the target pane, which RACES
> the user's live input — at a bash prompt the surface text runs as a command (`(eval):1: parse error`,
> dozens hit the operator today); at a Claude prompt it corrupts their half-typed message + cursor. v2
> moves delivery to a **durable inbox drained at a safe boundary via hooks** (arrives as context, never as
> keystrokes) with the **existing `cc-await-ping` background watcher** as the non-keystroke idle-wake. See
> **§ v2 — Eliminate keystroke injection** at the end of this doc. The v1 sections below are unchanged
> (historical); read them for the mailbox/registry primitives v2 builds on.

**Created**: 2026-07-10 · **Repo**: `claude-infrastructure` · **Research**:
[`docs/research/HANDOFF_BACKCHANNEL_2026-07-10.md`](../research/HANDOFF_BACKCHANNEL_2026-07-10.md)
(verdict: YES, live-proven; the it2 pane-injection transport already exists — this is the *plumbing*).

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE — landed on `origin/main`, verified green** (2026-07-18). All four components
shipped via clean commits (NOT the stale `feat/two-way-session-comms` branch — see Status log for SHAs
and the do-not-land warning). Re-verified this session: `bats` **38/38 pass**, `shellcheck` **clean**.
Nothing left to build.

**Scope (frozen)**: build a clean, performant, general **any-session → any-session message primitive**,
with `/handoff`'s `--notify-back` as its first consumer. A session (fired, teammate, or standalone)
can ping ANY other live session by a friendly name (or raw pane UUID) at any time, waking an idle
originator or queuing into a busy one, with a modal-safe mailbox fallback. 100th-percentile bar:
reuse the proven transport, zero new heavyweight deps, graceful degradation, tested.

**Non-goals**: no new transport (the it2 python-API shim is the transport, proven detached); no
cross-machine delivery (pane UUIDs are machine-local by design); no persistent message queue/broker
(mailbox files are the async fallback — "fix observed problems," not a broker).

---

## Design (4 components)

1. **Session registry** — each CC session records `{paneUUID, name, cwd, account, pid, startedAt}`
   on `SessionStart` (hook → append/update `~/.claude/sessions/<paneUUID>.json`), and prunes its
   entry on `SessionEnd`/exit. Gives name→UUID resolution + a `cc-sessions` lister. Stale entries
   (pane gone per `it2 session list`) are swept lazily on read. Name defaults to the cwd basename +
   short-UUID; user-overridable.
2. **`cc-notify` CLI** (`bin/cc-notify`, symlink → `~/.claude/bin/`) — the general primitive:
   `cc-notify <name|uuid|--self> "<message>"`. Resolves the target via the registry (raw UUID passes
   through), delivers via the it2 shim (`session send -s <uuid> "<msg>"` then `session send -s <uuid>
   $'\r'` — **`\r` not `\n`**, CC's Ink composer only submits on CR, research §mechanism), and ALSO
   appends to `~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.md` as the fallback record. Flags: `--list` (sessions table),
   `--self` (print own pane UUID), `--mailbox-only` (skip injection), `--from <name>` (attribution).
   Target pane closed/recycled → it2 exits non-zero → cc-notify still writes the mailbox and exits 0
   with a "delivered to mailbox only" note (never a hard failure).
3. **`--notify-back [name|uuid]` in `handoff-fire.sh`** — sugar for the handoff case. Forwards the
   originator's pane UUID (`FIRING_SID`, already computed at `handoff-fire.sh:496`; defaults to it)
   into a COPY of the fired prompt as a back-channel trailer telling the fired session the exact
   `cc-notify <uuid> "HANDOFF-PING <slug>: <status>"` recipe to run on completion / decision-gate /
   blocker. Research §"exact handoff-fire.sh change" has the ~10-line spec — implement it via
   `cc-notify` (not raw it2), so the recipe is one clean line.
4. **Originator-side await helper** `cc-await-ping [<uuid>]` — a `run_in_background`-friendly poller
   on `~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.md` (default: own UUID) that exits when a new line lands, so the
   harness's task-completion notification wakes the originator even if composer injection mislands
   (the modal-safe pull complement to the push). Bounded timeout, prints the new line(s).

**Data dirs**: `~/.claude/sessions/` (registry), `~/.claude/mailbox/` (fallback records). Both
git-ignored, created on first use.

---

## Step 0 — setup + baseline

1. `cd /Users/chrisren/Development/claude-infrastructure`; `git switch -c feat/two-way-session-comms`
   (branch — do not commit to `main` directly).
2. Read `docs/research/HANDOFF_BACKCHANNEL_2026-07-10.md` (transport, the `\r`-not-`\n` gotcha, the
   `--notify-back` spec, the mechanism table) + `scripts/handoff-fire.sh` (how it uses the it2 shim
   today: `FIRING_SID:496`, injection recipe `:141-145,176-178`, arg parser `:277-284`).
3. Inspect `~/.claude/bin/it2 --help` / its source to confirm the exact `session send` / `session
   list` subcommand surface before coding against it.

---

## Phase 0 — orchestration

The 3 build tasks are **tightly sequential** (T2 needs T1's registry format; T3 needs T2's CLI) and
total ~350 LOC of bash in ONE repo/domain — so a **single focused implementation session building
T1 → T2 → T3 in order** is the clean choice (Agent-Teams coordination overhead buys nothing when the
tasks can't parallelize). IF splitting is preferred, use 3 sequential teammates (one per phase,
spawn-after-merge), never parallel — the deps forbid it. Either way: commit per phase, gate each
(shellcheck + the bats tests), no push.

---

## Phase 1 — session registry + `cc-sessions`

- `hooks/session-register.sh` (SessionStart): write `~/.claude/sessions/<paneUUID>.json` with
  `{paneUUID, name, cwd, account(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR basename), pid, startedAt}`. Pane UUID from
  `$ITERM_SESSION_ID` (strip the `wNtNpN:` prefix → the bare UUID the it2 shim wants). Name =
  `$(basename "$PWD")-<short-uuid>` unless `CC_SESSION_NAME` is set.
- `hooks/session-deregister.sh` (SessionEnd): remove the file.
- Register both in the settings-template hooks wiring (`settings-templates/`), mirroring existing
  hook registration; document that existing sessions predating this won't be registered until restart.
- `bin/cc-sessions`: list registry entries, sweeping stale ones (cross-check `it2 session list`),
  columns name/uuid/cwd/account/age.
- **Gate**: `shellcheck` clean; a bats test that a fake registry entry lists + a stale one is swept.

## Phase 2 — `cc-notify` CLI

- `bin/cc-notify` per Design §2. Resolution order: exact name → raw-UUID passthrough → `--self`.
  Delivery: it2 `session send` text + CR; ALWAYS also append `~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.md`
  (`<ISO> [<from>] <message>`). Closed-pane fallback = mailbox-only, exit 0 + stderr note.
- `--list` delegates to `cc-sessions`; `--self` prints own bare UUID; `--mailbox-only`, `--from`.
- Symlink `~/.claude/bin/cc-notify → bin/cc-notify`.
- **Gate**: shellcheck; bats — name resolves to UUID; raw UUID passes through; `\r` submit uses the
  two-call recipe (assert the it2 invocation shape via a shim stub); closed pane → mailbox-only exit 0.
- **Live smoke** (post-merge, separate — like the research PoC): from a second pane, `cc-notify`
  this session by name; confirm the message lands in the composer.

## Phase 3 — `--notify-back` + await helper + docs + tests

- `handoff-fire.sh`: add `--notify-back [UUID]` (arg parser ~`:284`), and after `FIRING_SID` is
  derived (~`:497`) append the back-channel trailer to a COPY of the prompt file (never mutate the
  caller's), instructing the fired session to run `cc-notify <uuid> "HANDOFF-PING <slug>: <status>"`
  on completion / decision-gate / blocker. Default UUID = firing pane; `__self__` sentinel. Point
  `PROMPT_FILE` at the copy before `QP=` (~`:445`).
- `bin/cc-await-ping [<uuid>]`: bounded background poller on `~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.md`; exits on a
  new line. Symlink to `~/.claude/bin/`.
- **Docs**: update `commands/handoff.md` § Autonomous fire — a new bullet documenting `--notify-back`
  + the `cc-notify`/`cc-await-ping` pair (this is the two-way loop the skill's item 1 gap referenced),
  and note the `\r`-not-`\n` invariant. INTEGRATE (Edit), never rewrite.
- **Gate**: shellcheck; bats — `--notify-back` materializes the trailer with the right UUID + recipe
  and never mutates the caller's prompt file.

---

## 100th-percentile requirements (the bar)

- **Reuse, don't reinvent**: the it2 python-API shim is the ONLY keystroke channel (detached-proven;
  raw osascript AppleEvents fail silently detached — research §mechanism, `handoff-fire.sh:141-145`).
- **`\r` not `\n`** everywhere a CC composer is the target (Ink binds Enter to CR only).
- **Graceful degradation**: closed/recycled/missing pane never hard-fails — mailbox fallback + clean
  exit. A stale registry entry is swept, not trusted.
- **Idempotent + fast**: registry writes are single-file, O(1); `cc-notify` is two shim calls + one
  append; no polling in the push path (polling only in the opt-in `cc-await-ping`).
- **No secrets, no PII in mailbox/registry**; both dirs git-ignored.
- **Tested**: shellcheck-clean, bats coverage per phase, + a live cross-pane smoke for cc-notify.

## Constraints (HARD)

- Work on `feat/two-way-session-comms`; commit per phase (atomic, explicit paths); **do NOT push** —
  `/ship` (or `git push`) is the user's call. Never `--no-verify`.
- Do NOT stage the pre-existing `hooks/post-file-edit.sh` change or `accounts.json` (other work).
- Do NOT modify `~/.claude/bin/it2` (the transport is reused as-is unless a gap is proven — if so,
  STOP and surface it).
- INTEGRATE doc edits (Edit `commands/handoff.md`), never rewrite.
- Live smoke tests inject into REAL panes — target only scratch/second panes, never the user's active
  pane without saying so.

## References
- Research + mechanism table + the exact `--notify-back` code:
  `docs/research/HANDOFF_BACKCHANNEL_2026-07-10.md`.
- Transport in use today: `scripts/handoff-fire.sh` (`:141-145`, `:176-178`, `:496`, `:277-284`).

## Status log
- **2026-07-10** — Plan created from the live-proven research. NEXT: fresh-context session runs
  Step 0 → Phase 1 (registry) → Phase 2 (cc-notify) → Phase 3 (--notify-back + docs + tests),
  commits per phase on `feat/two-way-session-comms`, stops for the user's `/ship`.
- **2026-07-18** — ✅ **DONE — all four components landed on `origin/main` and re-verified green.**
  Shipped via **clean, comms-scoped commits** (a subsequent session split the work out of the
  plan's `feat/two-way-session-comms` branch, which had accreted unrelated `accounts`/`limit-recover`
  work, and landed only the comms slice):
  - **Phase 1** — session registry + `session-register.sh` / `session-deregister.sh` + `cc-sessions`
    lister: `827f164`, evolved by the P8 registry-forensics ruling `7b2f701` (see deviation below).
  - **Phase 2** — `cc-notify` general any-session→any-session primitive over the it2 transport:
    `3c232d3`, hardened by `98a3dd9` + `3b12107` (submit-VERIFY: the injected line is confirmed to
    have actually submitted — strand detection, CR retry, `exit 4` on a stranded composer — closing
    the "verifier could only abstain" hole).
  - **Phase 3** — `handoff-fire.sh --notify-back` + `cc-await-ping` + `commands/handoff.md` §8
    ("Two-way — back-channel ping"): `7acef7e`, extended by `5d2eb36` (`cc-await-ping --role`
    per-cycle re-resolve + `wiring-all` bin symlinks).
  - **Verification (this session, `origin/main`)**: `bats tests/{cc-notify,notify-back,session-registry}.bats`
    → **38/38 pass**; `shellcheck` on all delivered bins + hooks + `handoff-fire.sh` → **clean**
    (only info-level SC2009 suggestions). Data dirs (`~/.claude/sessions`, `~/.claude/mailbox`, the
    live `cc-registry`) live outside the repo; `~/.claude/bin/{cc-notify,cc-sessions,cc-await-ping}`
    symlinks are in place.
  - **Deviation from Phase 1 (by design, not a gap)**: the plan said "register **both** hooks in the
    settings template." Only `session-register.sh` is template-wired (`settings.example.json:265`);
    `session-deregister.sh` exists + is tested but is intentionally **not** template-wired. The P8
    ruling (`7b2f701`, "a reaper keyed on deadness erases the forensics") made registry retention an
    **age** decision (`CC_REG_RETAIN_H`, 24h), not an end/liveness one — so you wire *register*
    (accrue evidence) but not *deregister* (don't erase a dead session's row on exit), and the
    self-healing age-sweep in `cc-sessions` keeps addressing correct (a dead pane is hidden from
    resolution, retained for forensics). Full activation of the registration spine is deliberately
    operator-gated per `docs/rulings/P8-GO.md`.
  - **Follow-on already built ON TOP** (separate items, not this plan): the `comms-safety F1–F5`
    layer — `cc-announce` VERIFIED-or-LOUD primitive, channel-ladder law, back-channel payload-lint
    (`08dad8c` → `01b20eb`) — is the hardened application layer over this primitive.
  - **⚠️ Do NOT land `feat/two-way-session-comms`.** It is **stale/superseded** — `origin/main` is
    strictly newer (landing the branch would REVERT the submit-verify + P8 hardening, e.g. −60 lines
    of `cc-notify`), and the branch also carries unrelated `accounts`/`limit-recover`/`hooks` commits
    out of this plan's scope. cc-backlog `9775f356eb03` closed with the landed SHAs as evidence.

## Resume (v1)
**v1 is COMPLETE and landed on `origin/main`** (see the 2026-07-18 Status log entry for SHAs +
verification). Do NOT rebuild v1, and do NOT land the stale `feat/two-way-session-comms` branch
(superseded). v2 (below) is the ACTIVE work. To re-verify v1:
`bats tests/{cc-notify,notify-back,session-registry}.bats` + `shellcheck bin/cc-notify bin/cc-sessions
bin/cc-await-ping hooks/session-register.sh hooks/session-deregister.sh`.

# § v2 — Eliminate keystroke injection (2026-07-20)

**Scope (frozen):** a notification to a Claude session ALWAYS lands as a message/context the session
reads, and NEVER injects into the user's live input (text + cursor), whether the pane is at a Claude
prompt OR a bash prompt, and robust to pane state (idle, busy, mid-command, actively typing). Migrate
the delivery paths (`cc-notify` → reaper surface, supervisor page, `--notify-back`, `cc-announce`) onto
the safe channel. Keep a **fail-loud guard** (a dropped/undelivered message alarms, never silently
vanishes). **Preserve the wake** (the desk is still woken to triage) — via a non-keystroke channel.
Tests: delivery-lands-as-message-not-keystroke · delivery-survives-busy-pane · undelivered-alarms.
Land via the project-local `/ship`.

## Research findings — the non-keystroke delivery design space

The corruption source is **`it2 session send`** keystroke injection into the target pane. Three sites:
`bin/cc-notify:133-134` (the primitive — the central chokepoint), `scripts/handoff-fire.sh` (LAUNCH
prompt into a *fresh* pane — legit, no live input to corrupt — plus succession-announce which goes
*through* cc-notify), and `scripts/desk-invariant.sh:141-142` (`reprompt()` — a stall-recovery re-prompt,
a separate last-resort un-stick, NOT a routine notification). **`cc-notify` is the single migration
point:** reaper `notify_desk`, supervisor `page`/`page_permpend`, `--notify-back`, `cc-announce`, dispatch,
boot-resume, autonomy-sweep ALL deliver through it. Fix `cc-notify` → every path is fixed at once.

Candidate channels evaluated (harness semantics confirmed via claude-code-guide + the repo's own
battle-tested hook comments):

| Channel | Wakes idle? | Corrupts input? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **it2 `session send`** (today) | yes | **YES (the bug)** | ❌ remove |
| **Inbox + `UserPromptSubmit` `additionalContext`** | no (rides next user turn) | no | ✅ delivery (interactive) |
| **Inbox + `SessionStart` `additionalContext`** | no (rides resume/start) | no | ✅ delivery (resume) |
| **Inbox + `Stop` `decision:block` reason** | keeps an active session awake to triage | no | ✅ delivery (end-of-turn / desk loop) |
| **`cc-await-ping` background watcher → task-completion notification** | **yes** (the only non-keystroke idle-wake) | no | ✅ wake (already built) |
| MCP / Remote-Control / `FileChanged` hook | maybe | no | ⏳ undocumented on our version → not relied on |

**Load-bearing harness facts** (design turns on these):
- **No external process can wake a fully-idle CC session without keystrokes OR a pre-armed in-session
  background task** (confirmed). ⇒ the idle-wake MUST be the target's own armed `cc-await-ping`; there is
  no "push into an idle pane" that is both non-keystroke and external. This is a harness floor, not a
  design gap.
- **A `Stop` `decision:block` continuation does NOT re-fire `UserPromptSubmit`** (confirmed). ⇒ a desk
  looping via `session-continue` (Stop-block) never hits the `UserPromptSubmit` drain, so in-loop mail
  MUST be delivered on the **Stop** channel.
- **`Stop` `additionalContext` is empirically INERT on the running version** (`boundary-handoff.sh:22`,
  learned from a real escape — trumps the doc which says "active"). ⇒ the Stop channel uses
  `decision:block` (which `session-continue`/`completion-assert`/`anti-deference` all rely on), never
  `additionalContext`.
- **The cursor already exists**: `~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.seen` holds a line-count; `handoff-disposition.sh`
  reads `mailbox_pending` = (`wc -l <uuid>.md` > `<uuid>.seen`) and its `--ack` advances it. The drain
  MUST reuse this SAME cursor, so "delivered" and "pending" agree across both systems by construction.
- **`cc-await-ping` PRINTS the new mailbox line(s) to stdout on wake** — so when it fires, the mail
  content arrives *inside* the task-completion notification. For the idle desk it is delivery **and** wake
  in one; the hooks cover the non-watcher cases.

## The mechanism (chosen)

The mailbox (`~/.claude/mailbox/<uuid>.md`, append-only, `<ISO> [<from>] <message>` per line) is already
written by `cc-notify` on EVERY send (today labeled "fallback"). v2 **promotes the mailbox to the primary
transport** and removes keystroke injection. Delivery = **drain the mailbox at a safe boundary**; wake =
the target's armed watcher. One cursor (`<uuid>.seen`) makes delivery exactly-once across all channels.

1. **`hooks/mailbox-drain.sh`** (NEW) — one script, event-dispatched (arg `session-start`|`prompt`|`stop`):
   reads lines after `.seen`, formats them, and delivers. Advances `.seen` to EOF on delivery (idempotent,
   exactly-once, and consistent with `handoff-disposition`'s `--ack`).
   - `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` → emit as `additionalContext` (reliable). Advance `.seen`.
   - `Stop` → if pending, `decision:block` with the mail as the reason (wakes an active session to triage;
     the only in-loop channel). Advance `.seen`. **Coexistence:** a shared `hooks/lib/mailbox-pending.sh`
     helper lets the other Stop-blockers yield one turn when mail is pending (see Phase 2) so at most one
     hook blocks — additive, fail-safe (yield = allow-stop = the safe direction).
2. **`bin/cc-notify`** — REMOVE `it2 session send` entirely. New job: resolve target → **enqueue to the
   mailbox** (durable) → classify deliverability for an honest exit code. Liveness via `cc-sessions`
   (live registry) / `it2 session list` (read-only, no keystrokes): target is a LIVE session → exit 0
   "delivered to inbox" (a drain/watcher will surface it); target not live (closed/recycled) → exit 0
   "mailbox only" (a dead inbox — the `cc-announce` alarm path still fires); unresolvable → exit 3;
   **mailbox unwritable → exit 5 LOUD** (a message that can't even persist must alarm, not warn). No more
   "submit VERIFIED"/strand/exit-4 (there is no keystroke to strand).
3. **`bin/cc-announce`** — update `classify()`: VERIFIED = "delivered to inbox (live session)"; MAILBOX
   (target-not-live) / UNRESOLVED / write-fail = LOUD alarm (unchanged VERIFIED-or-LOUD contract; the W5
   "RELOAD ≠ WAKE" lesson holds — a dead inbox is not a delivery). The mailbox-write to a LIVE session IS
   a wake now (the target's watcher pulls it), so mailbox-to-a-live-target is no longer a degrade.
4. **Wake** — unchanged mechanism, now primary: the desk (and any `--notify-back` originator) keeps a
   background `cc-await-ping` armed while idle; a `cc-notify` mailbox write makes it exit → task-completion
   notification re-invokes the session with the mail in the notification body. Non-keystroke, already built.
5. **Fail-loud guard `bin/cc-inbox-guard`** (NEW) — sweeps mailboxes; for any whose owning session is LIVE
   (registered + pane/pid alive) and whose oldest undelivered line (`.seen` < EOF; line ISO timestamp)
   is older than a deadline (default 600s), escalates via `push-send.sh` (the VERIFIED phone leg) + writes
   an alarm record. A message enqueued but never drained CANNOT silently vanish. Wired into the existing
   autonomy/reaper cron; `--selftest` RED-proves the alarm fires.

**Out of scope / noted:** `desk-invariant.sh:reprompt()` (stall-recovery keystroke un-stick — a separate
last-resort actuator, gated by stall detection, not a routine notification; forcing a turn on a *wedged*
session is exactly what inbox-drain cannot do). `handoff-fire.sh` fresh-pane LAUNCH injection (no live
input to corrupt). Both stay; documented so the remaining keystroke sites are explicit, not hidden.

## Phase 0 — orchestration (single focused session, by design)

Same call as v1 Phase 0, same reason: the pieces are **one tightly-coupled contract** — the `.seen` cursor
semantics, `cc-notify`'s new exit codes, `cc-announce`'s `classify()`, the Stop-hook yield-protocol, and
their tests all interlock. Parallel teammates would race the shared contract (exit codes / "verified"
meaning / cursor) and create merge hazard on the exact interfaces that must stay coherent. Total ≈350–450
LOC across `bin/cc-notify` (rewrite ~−40/+40), `bin/cc-announce` (~+15), `hooks/mailbox-drain.sh` (NEW ~120),
`hooks/lib/mailbox-pending.sh` (NEW ~25), 4 safety-hook 2-line guards, `bin/cc-inbox-guard` (NEW ~90),
tests. Under the 500-LOC single-owner threshold and non-parallelizable ⇒ **single session, commit per
phase, gate each** (shellcheck + bats). Research fan-out (already done) used background subagents only.

## Phase 1 — mailbox-drain hook + cursor (delivery, no keystrokes)
- `hooks/mailbox-drain.sh`: shared `drain(uuid)` → lines `(.seen, EOF]`; `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit`
  → `additionalContext`; `Stop` → `decision:block`. Advance `.seen`. Env seams `CC_MAILBOX_DIR`. Fail-safe:
  every path exits 0 except the Stop-block (which is the intended block). No `set -e`.
- `hooks/lib/mailbox-pending.sh`: `mailbox_has_pending <uuid>` + `mailbox_drain_recently_fired <uuid>`
  (breadcrumb `<uuid>.draining`, 2s freshness) → `mailbox_defer_to_drain <uuid>` (0 = should-yield).
- Wire `mailbox-drain.sh` into `settings-templates/settings.example.json` on SessionStart (first),
  UserPromptSubmit (first), Stop (first in obj-1).
- **Gate**: shellcheck; bats — delivery-lands-as-message (additionalContext shape) + cursor advances
  exactly-once + Stop emits decision:block.

## Phase 2 — cc-notify transport swap + Stop-hook coexistence + cc-announce
- `bin/cc-notify`: remove it2 send; enqueue + liveness-classify + exit codes (§ mechanism 2). Keep
  `--mailbox-only`, `--from`, `--self`, `--list`. Update the header contract.
- Add the `mailbox_defer_to_drain` yield-guard (source `hooks/lib/mailbox-pending.sh`) to
  `session-continue.sh`, `completion-assert.sh`, `anti-deference-nudge.sh`, `boundary-handoff.sh` — top of
  the actuation path, additive, exit 0 on yield.
- `bin/cc-announce`: update `classify()` per § mechanism 3.
- **Gate**: shellcheck; bats — cc-notify never calls `session send` (stub asserts 0 invocations),
  delivery-survives-busy-pane (busy/any pane → mailbox written, composer untouched), cc-announce
  VERIFIED-or-LOUD holds on the new outputs; the 4 guards yield when mail pending.

## Phase 3 — fail-loud guard + docs + full gate
- `bin/cc-inbox-guard` + `--selftest`; wire into the autonomy/reaper cron.
- Update `commands/handoff.md` §8 + `bin/cc-notify`/`cc-await-ping` headers: the transport is now
  inbox-drain, NOT keystroke; the `\r`-not-`\n` note becomes historical.
- **Gate**: shellcheck all touched bins/hooks; `bats tests/` green (updated cc-notify/cc-announce/
  notify-back + the 3 new suites); then project-local `/ship`.

## Critique fixes (adversarial red-team, 2026-07-20) — FOLD BEFORE SHIP

A 5-lens adversarial critique (wf_ac5f975e-1c0) of the frozen design returned **14 survivors** — verdict
"sound WITH fixes, not a rethink." The foundation holds (cc-notify IS the single chokepoint; fresh-pane
launch never touches a live composer; the drain jq-escapes peer content; the Phase-1 breadcrumb ordering
closes the basic parallel race). But the fail-loud + wake guarantees and the operator's literal complaint
were NOT fully met. The two architectural fixes SIMPLIFY the design:

- **(A) Split the delivery cursor from the ack/guard cursor.** `<uuid>.seen` = EMITTED (advanced by the
  drain, AFTER emitting — emit-before-advance). `<uuid>.acked` = CONSUMED (advanced only when a boundary
  proves the model took a turn: immediately on the reliable additionalContext channels; lag-one-cycle for
  the Stop channel). The fail-loud guard keys on `acked < EOF`, NEVER the eager `seen`. Closes F2, cures
  F11's guard-blindness, gives F5 its clean "delivered" definition, retires the raw-EOF `--ack` writer.
- **(B) Fold in-loop Stop delivery into `session-continue` (the ONE hook already blocking the in-loop
  desk); DROP the standalone mailbox-drain Stop blocker + the 4-hook yield-guards + the 2 s TTL.** The
  drain handles SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit only. Removes the multi-block blast radius (F10), the
  fragile wall-clock sync, and the re-arm starvation (F14) in one move. Idle/mid-turn mail is caught by
  the F6 watcher on arm; the looping desk by the fold; interactive/resume by additionalContext.

| # | Sev | Defect (file) | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | must | TOCTOU: concurrent append between the drain's read and `.seen`-advance → silent drop; hot target = desk | `flock` a single atomic snapshot; serialize every `.seen` RMW; standardize `grep -c ''` (not `wc -l`) everywhere |
| **F2** | must | `.seen` advances at emit-time; guard keys on same cursor → dropped mail (hook-kill / double-block) invisible | **(A)** split emitted/acked; emit-before-advance |
| **F3** | must | `cc-announce classify()` fail-open `else VERIFIED` reports exit-5 write-fail as a confirmed wake | rc5→WRITEFAIL (DONE) + flip terminal default to fail-CLOSED (alarm) + selftest/bats exit-5 case (DONE) |
| **F4** | must | exit-5 (inbox unwritable) is swallowed by every fire-and-forget caller → "loud" only in its number | `cc-notify` self-escalates on write-fail: alarm record in a durable dir + best-effort `push-send.sh` |
| **F5** | blocker | VERIFIED = "registered-live" equates liveness with a wake → W5 recreated under a VERIFIED label | Award VERIFIED only on a confirmed WAKE PATH (armed `cc-await-ping` for the uuid, or drain-confirmed via `acked`); live-but-unwatched idle → a distinct degrade `cc-announce` alarms on |
| **F6** | must | idle-desk wake unimplemented: `cc-await-ping` baselines at `wc -l` (off `.seen`), one-shot, nothing re-arms | seed baseline from `mailbox_seen`; advance `.seen` on fire; a SUPERVISED auto-re-arming desk watcher (guard kicks/re-arms before phoning the operator) |
| **F7** | must | `desk-invariant reprompt()` still injects text+Enter into the desk's LIVE composer on the stale branch (gated only on assistant-idle ≈ operator-returns-and-types) — the operator's verbatim complaint | ABORT reprompt if the composer is non-empty/changed since last sweep; for the pure-stale branch, enqueue the resume to the desk's OWN mailbox instead of keystrokes; keystroke only a proven-frozen cap-modal |
| **F8** | high | `cc-inbox-guard` fails SILENT on an unclassifiable owner (not-registered ⇒ treated dead ⇒ no escalation) | liveness by PANE existence (`it2 session list`), run `cc-reconcile` first; INDETERMINATE owner ⇒ ESCALATE (fail-loud) |
| **F9** | high | Stop drain has no cap/latch; a swallowed `.seen`-write failure re-blocks the same mail every Stop forever | (mostly retired by **B**) + `mailbox_advance_seen` RETURNS failure; folded-delivery caps like its siblings; on advance-fail allow-stop + escalate |
| **F10** | med | single-blocker is unenforced convention across 5 files + fragile 2 s TTL | retired by **B** (no competing blocker) |
| **F11** | med | cursor-past-EOF (GC/rotation/recycle) → drop + guard blind | clamp `.seen>cur`→0 re-deliver (DONE in lib) + guard ALSO alarms on `.seen>EOF`; GC = atomic compact-and-reset under the lock |
| **F12** | med | uniform 600 s guard deadline loses v1's instant urgency for confirmed-stuck classes | class-specific short deadline (~0–60 s) for permission-pending / coordination-hang / crashed / DEAD |
| **F13** | minor | multi-line message breaks line==message + ISO-per-line age-parse | collapse newlines→spaces (DONE in cc-notify) |
| **F14** | low | mail Stop replaces `session-continue`'s reason → re-arm reminder starved → `.count` hits cap, loop abandons | retired by **B** (fold keeps the re-arm reminder in the same reason) |

**Ship gate:** none of Phase 2/3 lands until A, B, F1, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9 are in. F10/F13/F14 are
retired by A/B; F11/F12 are cheap hardening folded into `cc-inbox-guard`.

## v2 Status log
- **2026-07-20** — v2 opened. Research → design frozen → Phase 1 built → adversarial critique (14 fixes) →
  **all must-fixes folded + implemented + tested + gate-green.** Commits (branch `feat/twoway-comms-100`):
  - `19b35ae` research+design · `6cb7c7f`+`e420e30` Phase-1 drain+lib+tests · `a721ce0` critique-fixes design.
  - `a1f241e` **(A)** split cursor `.seen`/`.acked` + **(F1)** locked atomic `mailbox_take` + **(B)** fold
    Stop delivery into `session-continue` (drop the standalone Stop blocker + 4-hook yield-guards) +
    **(F6a)** `cc-await-ping` seeds from `.seen` + **(F9)** advance-returns-failure.
  - `8df066a` **(F5)** wake-path VERIFIED (a `<uuid>.watching` heartbeat, not mere liveness — the W5
    lesson) + **(F3)** `cc-announce` fail-CLOSED + **(F4)** `cc-notify` exit-5 self-escalation.
  - `72e0d37` **(F7)** `desk-invariant` re-engages via the inbox, NEVER keystrokes a live composer (the
    operator's literal complaint — the third + last keystroke site eliminated).
  - `1bc1601` **`cc-inbox-guard`** — the fail-loud backstop (F5/F6/F8/F11/F12/F4): undelivered-to-a-live-
    session mail escalates to the phone; keys on `.acked` so an eager `.seen` can't hide a loss.
  - `efb6267` wiring: drain hooks on SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit; guard rides the reaper cadence;
    delivery-survives-busy-pane proof. `6f2f83a` docs §8.
  - **Gate:** `shellcheck -S warning` clean on all touched bins/hooks/scripts; the three required suites
    (delivery-lands-as-message-not-keystroke = cc-notify 17/17 + mailbox-drain 10/10; delivery-survives-
    busy-pane; undelivered-alarms = cc-inbox-guard 12/12) + cc-announce 10/10, desk-invariant 6/6,
    completion-push, handoff-fire, cc-reaper 35/35 all green.
  - **Keystroke sites eliminated (3/3):** `cc-notify` (the chokepoint — reaper/supervisor/notify-back/
    cc-announce all ride it), `desk-invariant reprompt()`, and any composer-inject path. `handoff-fire`'s
    FRESH-pane launch (empty new pane, no live input) is the only remaining `session send` — legitimately
    out of scope.
  - **Post-land (operator C10):** activate the drain hooks in the LIVE `settings.json` across the 4 config
    dirs (the template is wired; the live per-account settings are the operator's step, like boundary-handoff).
    NEXT: land via project-local `/ship`.
