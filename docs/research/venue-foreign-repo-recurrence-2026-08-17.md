# The 08-16 prediction came true in 24 hours, on the second project it named

**2026-08-17.** Backlog item `c33f3b1cb278`, **project `reso-management-app`**, was dispatched to a
`--venue cloud` session whose one attached repository is `renchris/claude-infrastructure`. Its brief
names `/Users/chrisren/Development/reso-management-app` and cites `operationBuilder.ts:553-562`,
`batchPrefetch.ts:350-355` and `appActions.ts`. None is reachable here, so the item was **unworkable
on arrival** — the fourth such dispatch in four days.

`cloud-venue-project-repo-mismatch-2026-08-16.md` §4 closes with this sentence:

> Until one of those ships, **every** non-`claude-infrastructure` item fired via `cc-offload up` from
> this checkout burns a cloud session that cannot reach its own subject. The dispatch set currently
> lists two such projects (`scripts/dispatch-projects.conf`): `doc_classifier` and
> `reso-management-app`.

That was written one day ago. The three prior occurrences were all `doc_classifier` (or
`doc_classifier`-subjected). **This is the first `reso-management-app` one** — the second of the two
named projects, firing within ~24h of the prediction. That is the whole contribution of this file: a
prediction moving from argued to observed, on the project that had not yet been observed.

## The occurrences

*(rows appended as each new VM writes its own; nothing above is restated by them)*

| date | item | `project` | route |
|---|---|---|---|
| 08-14 | `1cc794cbc6c4` | `doc_classifier` | label-foreign |
| 08-15 | `9333991e4544` | `claude-infrastructure` | subject-foreign (label passes, text is about `doc_classifier`) |
| 08-16 | `c07fb00eb9b6` | `doc_classifier` | label-foreign — **located the cause** at `bin/cc-offload:84` |
| 08-17 | `c33f3b1cb278` | `reso-management-app` | label-foreign |
| 08-17 | `5ab3327ed0c8` | `reso-management-app` | label-foreign **+ store-foreign** — see § The fifth |
| 08-17 | `38de29ec5e59` | `doc_classifier` | label-foreign — **second cloud burn of the same item** (§ below) |
| 08-19 | `ce7651b02a17` | `doc_classifier` | label-foreign — **the guard already fires from here and cannot fire there** (§ SEVENTH) |

The 08-17 `reso-management-app` row is a **repeat of the 08-14/08-16 route**, not a fifth route. The class has stopped producing
new spellings and is now producing recurrences on a known mechanism — which is why nothing about the
discriminator is re-derived below.

🚨 **This table is UNDERCOUNTED, and the closing question below is now ANSWERED — 2026-08-17,
~08:52Z.** `8f59467c92b0` (project `claude-infrastructure`, the cross-repo product-repos master) was
misrouted **twice**: on 08-15 — an occurrence absent from this table because that worker recorded it
in `docs/plans/MASTER_PRODUCT_REPOS.md` rather than in a `venue-*` file, inside a commit
(`b4ddaa27`) about something else entirely — and again ~1.5h after this file landed. The true figure
is **six dispatches over five distinct items**, and any count taken from the `venue-*` family is a
floor. That re-dispatch also settles this file's *"the conclusion never reached the enforcing store"*
question at full resolution: the 08-15 disproof was written into the item's own DoD-ref plan, the
most on-topic location available, and bought two days — nothing in the dispatch chain reads plan
prose. **And it refutes the remedy as filed:** both §3 options of the 08-16 doc PASS that row, since
its `project` label is accurate and only the plan BODY names the foreign trees.
`venue-foreign-master-redispatch-2026-08-17.md`.

## The cause is settled; the fix is a pending decision

`cloud-venue-project-repo-mismatch-2026-08-16.md` §2 located it and this file does not improve on it:
`REPO="${CC_OFFLOAD_REPO:-$ROOT}"` (`bin/cc-offload:84`) derives the attached repo from **the firing
checkout's** origin, and the item's `project` field is never consulted or compared. Fire from
`~/Development/claude-infrastructure` and every session gets `renchris/claude-infrastructure`
attached, whatever the brief is about.

That doc's §3 also frames the remedy correctly, and this session endorses it against the reading it
displaces: the gap is **structural — a property of the pair** (`item.project`,
`session.attached_repo`) — not a missing spelling in `bin/cc-eligible`. Two shapes are on the table,
**(a) fail closed** at fire time and **(b) route by `item.project`**, and choosing between them
depends on facts unverifiable from any VM (GitHub App installation on the second repo, whether
`cc-offload land` works against it). So this is not a specified-but-unbuilt fix; it is an **open
decision, filed 2026-08-16, now carrying a fourth datapoint of cost.**

For completeness, since the earlier files proposed a `cc-eligible`-side conjunct: the 08-14 conjunct
(*a `cloud` label requires the item's project repo to be the attached one*) would also refuse this
row on the label alone. It is the weaker of the two placements — it gates the *claim*, while
`cc-offload` gates the *fire*, and it is the fire that spends the slot.

## Measured from inside this session

| what | value |
|---|---|
| clone | `git rev-list --count HEAD` → **51**, `.git/shallow` present |
| `~/Development` (`/root/Development`), `/Users` | both absent |
| GitHub scope | `renchris/claude-infrastructure`, one repository |
| the three cited files | 0 hits over the checkout |

`cc-eligible` reads the row as cloud-suitable — correctly, on its own terms, exactly as on all three
prior occasions. The item names no local-only state, cites no sha, needs no browser, no pane, no
`launchd`. Recorded because one spelling had not been probed before: the brief names its subject as
an **absolute repo path**, and that form is read as nothing either.

| probe | verdict |
|---|---|
| the item's full text | `eligible` · classes `[]` |
| `/Users/chrisren/Development/reso-management-app` alone | `eligible` · classes `[]` |
| `project reso-management-app, repo /Users/chrisren/…` | `eligible` · classes `[]` |
| `~/Development/reso-management-app` | `eligible` · classes `[]` |

🚨 **This is a measurement, not a proposed arm.** Adding a path spelling to `bin/cc-eligible` would
be widening a denylist on a hunch — the thing that file's own header (`:25-37`) forbids — and it
would place the guard at the claim rather than at the fire. The row is here to close the question
"was it a spelling all along?" with a no, not to reopen it.

## The rails handed to this dispatch fail QUIETLY here

Worth recording once, because it is a trap for the next worker rather than a fact about this item.
The brief's blocked-path instructions are `cc-backlog block` / `cc-backlog reopen` plus
`cc-notify --role desk`. `~/.claude/autonomy/` does not exist on this VM, so both **exit 0 while
doing nothing**:

```
$ cc-backlog reopen c33f3b1cb278
cc-backlog reopen: unknown id c33f3b1cb278                            # rc 0

$ cc-notify --role desk "…"
cc-notify: verdict=unresolvable enqueued=0 reason=role-unset          # rc 0
```

A worker that ran them and trusted the exit code would report the item parked when it is not. A
cloud VM's only durable channel to the desk is the branch it pushes, so this file is the
notification.

## Operator actions

The decision from `cloud-venue-project-repo-mismatch-2026-08-16.md` §3 — **(a) fail closed vs (b)
route by project** — is unchanged and is the one that stops all four. This adds only the ledger
disposition for this item, which needs the Mac:

```
cc-backlog block c33f3b1cb278 --needs "re-dispatch to a session that can reach reso-management-app — a local claim, or a cloud fire whose attached git_repository source IS reso-management-app; premise NOT adjudicated (docs/research/venue-foreign-repo-recurrence-2026-08-17.md)"
```

`block` rather than `reopen`: the item is not blocked on information or on a judgment call, it is
blocked on **where it was sent**, and parking it out of the dispatch wave is what stops it being
re-fired into the same VM shape before the guard exists.

## Not fixed here, deliberately

`bin/cc-eligible`'s `OFFBOX_LANE` class states the binding rule: *a session this lane created cannot
verify a change to the lane — the observer and the subject are the same object.* `bin/cc-venue`'s
header says the same of a 50-commit clone deciding its own admission. `bin/cc-offload` fires paid
cloud sessions, and neither `bats` nor `shellcheck` is installed here, so the repo's gate cannot be
run on a shell change — landing an ungated guard into the fire path would trade a bounded waste for
an unbounded one. All three refusals are the 08-16 session's, restated because they still hold.

## The item itself — NOT adjudicated

No claim is made about the `/list` concurrent-delete orphan, and none should be inferred. The
`LIST_HAS_ITEMS` guard, `batchPrefetch`'s `deleteList` case and `appActions.ts`'s admin CVR scoping
were never readable from this session. The brief's own mandated first step — *read what this item
cites on TRUNK, because a post-land RED reproduces faithfully in a stale tree* (`cc-backlog
6110fc45141e`) — is unrunnable here for the strongest possible reason: there is no tree, stale or
otherwise. Diagnosing it from the brief's prose is the anti-goal `bin/cc-venue` §5 names — *"a
wrongly-routed item improvises a plausible answer against history it cannot read, and reports
success."*

---

# The fifth, same day — and the first whose subject is in NO repo

**2026-08-17, second dispatch.** Backlog item `5ab3327ed0c8`, project `reso-management-app`, title
*"MEMORY.md at 23842 B of 24985 B cap — compact to <17.1KB"*, fired into a second cloud session with
the same one attached repository. Appended here rather than filed as its own note because it is the
same class on the same day and the anti-capture rule is explicit about near-duplicates — but it
carries **three facts the four above do not**, and the third changes the item's disposition.

## 1 · Store-foreign, not merely label-foreign — a new sub-case

The prior four were all *repo*-subjected: real source files, in a real repo, that this VM had not
cloned. Route (b) — *route by `item.project`* — would have made every one of them workable.

This one is not reachable by route (b) either. Its subject is the **project memory index**, which
Claude Code keys on the session's cwd and stores at

```
$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<slugify(repo root)>/memory/MEMORY.md
```

— i.e. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-chrisren-Development-reso-management-app/memory/MEMORY.md`. That
path is **in no git repository at all**. Resolution measured, not assumed: `hooks/memory-nudge.sh:93-113`
builds it from `--git-common-dir`; `scripts/worktree-memory-link.sh:4-9` states the keying and the
consequence; `bin/cc-memory-rotate:26-29` refuses any path not matching `*/memory/MEMORY.md`,
"a repo file merely named MEMORY.md has no read limit to protect."

So the pair this class is normally about — (`item.project`, `session.attached_repo`) — is not the
whole discriminator. **A third state exists: the subject is not a repo object.** Attaching
`reso-management-app` would leave this item exactly as unworkable as attaching nothing. Whichever of
(a)/(b) the open 08-16 decision picks, this row needs the `~/.claude`-store arm as well.

## 2 · `cc-eligible` has the right spelling and the item walks past it

Unlike the four above — where §"Measured from inside this session" correctly concludes *no spelling
would have caught it* — this file's `BOX` list **does** carry the exact class, added 2026-08-11 (W1):

```python
("dot-claude", r"~/\.claude\b|\$HOME/\.claude\b"),   # THE LIVE LAYER
```

with the comment *"`~/.claude` DOES NOT EXIST on the VM … the artifact under discussion is not in the
repo at all."* That is this item, precisely. It is missed because the title names the **file**
(`MEMORY.md`) and never the **store** (`~/.claude`), and `SPAN_FIELDS` is title/dodRef/condition/source:

| probe | verdict |
|---|---|
| the item's full title | `eligible` · classes `[]` |
| `+ condition memory-index-over-budget` | `eligible` · classes `[]` |
| the same subject written `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/MEMORY.md` | `ineligible-box` · `dot-claude` |

🚨 **Recorded as a measurement; deliberately not fixed here.** Same three refusals the 08-16 and
c33f3b1cb278 sessions gave, all still binding: `bin/cc-eligible`'s own `OFFBOX_LANE` states that *a
session this lane created cannot verify a change to the lane — the observer and the subject are the
same object*, and its `venue` spelling exists to refuse exactly an item asking to edit that file;
`bin/cc-venue` abstains in a 50-commit clone by measurement. Re-confirmed here: `.git/shallow`
present, `git rev-list --count origin/main` → **50**. And the gate cannot be run on a shell change —
`bats` and `shellcheck` are both **ABSENT** on this VM (`jq` and `python3` are present; an earlier
`command -v bats jq` in this session returned 0 on `jq` alone and briefly read as "bats ok", which is
why this line names each tool separately).

The narrowing this needs is also **not** a hunch-widening of the kind the header forbids — the class
is already in the list and the question is only which spellings reach it. But it is still a change to
the admission predicate, so it routes home.

## 3 · The item is probably already serviced, and its premise is in a superseded unit

This is the part that makes the disposition differ from the four above, and it is why the brief's
mandated *"if the cure is already on trunk, the item is DONE"* step matters here even though the
subject is unreachable.

**A landed actuator already services this exact condition, fleet-wide.** `hooks/memory-nudge.sh:178-229`
("ACTUATE, then advise") invokes `bin/cc-memory-rotate` on **every** prompt whose index is at/over
`ROTATE_AT`, for whatever project the session's cwd resolves to — not just this repo. Both files are
present on `origin/main` (content-verified; the exact landing sha is not attributable from a clone
grafted at 50 commits, where everything older collapses onto the boundary commit `b4fc288e`). Its
header records why it exists: twelve hand-compactions in fourteen days, because *"insertion is
machine-speed … while removal was human-speed."* Hand-compacting this index is the work that
mechanism was built to stop anyone doing.

Positive control, run here against a synthetic index (200 entry lines + linked topic files):

```
before 25609 B → verdict=rotated moved=37 stage2=0 after=21355 B
                 cold=…/archive/MEMORY_ARCHIVE_2026-H2-COLD.md
```

The rotor works. Lines move verbatim; restore is a paste.

**And the item's numbers are in the unit corrected on 2026-08-15** (`cc-backlog 7a56de4c54ab`,
derivation in `hooks/lib/memory-index-measure.sh`). "23842 B of 24985 B cap" is raw disk bytes; the
loader strips YAML frontmatter and block HTML comments, trims, and compares **characters** against
**25000** — including stripping the `<!-- cold tier: … -->` pointer the rotor itself writes.
`cc-memory-rotate:36-49` reconciles this by shifting its thresholds up by the measured gap. Measured
here on a fixture at **23824 raw B** — within 18 B of the item's stated size:

```
loader-vs-disk overhead 401 B — thresholds shifted to limit=25401 rotate_at=23901 target=21401
verdict=noop size=23824 rotate_at=23901
```

**A file at this item's stated raw size read `noop`** — under the threshold, nothing to do. The
overhead is per-file, so this does not prove reso's index is fine; it proves the item's headline
figure cannot decide the question, because it is not in the unit the cap is enforced in.

One genuine mismatch survives either way: the item asks for **<17.1KB** (≈70% of 24985). The rotor's
`TARGET` is `LIMIT-4000` ≈ **21000**. No landed mechanism drives to 17.1KB, and reaching it would
mean archiving well past the sanctioned ~2.5-4 KB headroom — the **lossy, human-gated** half of
`/compact-memory`, not the rotor's reversible cold split. That target looks like a filing session's
own choice rather than any mechanism's.

## 4 · The rails, re-measured (one differs from the record above)

Same trap, one correction. `cc-notify` still fails **silently**:

```
$ cc-notify --role desk "…"
cc-notify: verdict=unresolvable enqueued=0 uuid= reason=role-unset    # rc 0
```

But `cc-backlog reopen` did **not** exit 0 here:

```
$ cc-backlog reopen 5ab3327ed0c8
cc-backlog reopen: unknown id 5ab3327ed0c8                            # rc 3
```

The §"rails fail QUIETLY" block above records rc 0 for this call. On this VM it is rc 3. The
operative warning is unchanged and now sharper: **`cc-notify` is the silent one** — a worker that
chains the two and checks only the last exit code reports a desk notification that was never
enqueued. This branch remains the only durable channel.

## 5 · Operator actions for `5ab3327ed0c8`

The 08-16 decision — **(a) fail closed vs (b) route by project** — is unchanged and still the one
that stops the class, with the §1 caveat that this row needs the `~/.claude`-store arm too, since (b)
alone does not reach it.

This item's own disposition is **not** re-dispatch. Re-measure the premise in the live unit first; if
it is under the cap, nothing needs doing and the standing condition already has an actuator:

```
cc-backlog block 5ab3327ed0c8 --needs "re-measure reso's index in the LOADER unit on the Mac — cc-memory-rotate ~/.claude/projects/-Users-chrisren-Development-reso-management-app/memory/MEMORY.md --dry-run --verbose. verdict=noop ⇒ close as already-serviced (memory-nudge auto-rotates fleet-wide at ROTATE_AT); verdict=rotated ⇒ it has already fixed itself. Re-open ONLY if a real target below the rotor's ~21000-char TARGET is wanted — that is /compact-memory's lossy, human-gated half, not the rotor's. Item's '23842 B of 24985 B' is the raw-byte unit superseded 2026-08-15 (7a56de4c54ab); premise NOT adjudicated (docs/research/venue-foreign-repo-recurrence-2026-08-17.md § The fifth)."
```

`block` rather than `reopen`, for the reason given above and one more: `reopen` returns it to the
wave, and the guard that would stop it being re-fired into this same VM shape does not exist yet.

## 6 · The item itself — NOT adjudicated

Whether reso's index is over its cap today was never readable from this session. `/root/.claude/projects/`
contains exactly one entry, this session's own `-home-user-claude-infrastructure`; `/Users` and
`/root/Development` are absent. Everything in §3 is a measurement of the **mechanism** — on trunk, and
on synthetic fixtures built here — never of the operator's index. No compaction was performed, none
should be inferred, and the 17.1KB target is reported as a mismatch to adjudicate, not as a defect
found.

# FIFTH OCCURRENCE, same day, later fire — `38de29ec5e59`, and this item had already burned a cloud session once

*Written from inside that fifth VM, appended to this file rather than given a third one: the class
and its cause are settled above and are not re-derived. Two facts here are new.*

**2026-08-17.** Backlog item `38de29ec5e59`, **project `doc_classifier`**, was dispatched to a
`--venue cloud` session whose one attached repository is `renchris/claude-infrastructure`. Its brief
names `/Users/chrisren/Development/doc_classifier` and its DoD ref is
`pipeline/backbone/port/build.py#L125`. Neither is reachable here — the same label-foreign route as
08-14 and 08-16, on the same project.

## New fact 1 — the class is older than this table's first row, and **this item opened it**

`bin/cc-dispatch:619-626` records item `38de29ec5e59` as *"the very first producer-routed dispatch
(session_01YcTifmgrKh3KFYuz45Rret, fired 2026-08-11T20:30Z)"* — three days before the 08-14 row.
That fire failed by a **different mechanism**, which is why it is recorded here and deliberately
**not** added to the table above: it went through `handoff-fire`'s cloud leg, the deprecated CLI
create, which *"bundle-retries, DELIVERS NO BRIEF … the session sat NOT-STARTED forever"*, and the
dispatcher's follow-up declare *"OVERWROTE the leg's correct declaration with the worktree name as
the branch, so the reconcile watched a branch the VM would never push"* (`bin/cc-dispatch:1972-1983`).
It was also born UNMANAGED — no custody, no wake, no auto-land (`:619-626`).

So `38de29ec5e59` is the first item known to have burned **two** cloud sessions, by two different
actuators, with **zero turns of work on its subject** either time: once because the brief never
arrived, once because the subject repo did not. The per-item cost of an unfixed venue is therefore
not bounded at one session — the dispatcher re-fires the row, and each new actuator introduces its
own way to waste it.

## New fact 2 — unlike the 08-17 `reso` item, this item's premise and supersession **are** adjudicable from this repo, and both resolve in its favour

The 08-17 `reso-management-app` row above could only be left NOT adjudicated, because nothing in this
checkout speaks to it. This one is different: a triage of `doc_classifier` ran **in this repo** and
its report is here.

**Premise — CONFIRMED, by a reader newer than the filing.**
`docs/plans/backlog-consolidation-2026-08-09/OUT-docclf.md:47` records a **KEEP** verdict for
`38de29ec5e59` from a run against `doc_classifier` `origin/main` @ `cc6a30a6a62c…`, with the
sub-claims read live:

- `pipeline/backbone/port/build.py:126-137` — `_stage_uv` runs
  `pip download uv==<UV_VERSION> --no-deps --only-binary=:all: <platform_args> -d <scratch>`:
  **no `--require-hashes`, no `--index-url`**.
- `build.py:480-492` — the sibling wheelhouse fetch **does** pass `--require-hashes -r requirements.lock`.
  The asymmetry the item names is real and is in one file.
- `build.py:118-122` — the `_stage_uv` docstring itself claims the binary is *"fetched with the same
  `pip download --only-binary` mechanism as the wheelhouse"* and that *"the binary's own sha256 joins
  PACKAGE_MANIFEST.json"* — i.e. **the code's own documentation states the self-referential property
  the item flags**: the packager *records* the sha it just downloaded rather than checking it against
  a pin, so `verify-package.sh` can only confirm the manifest agrees with itself.

The filed DoD ref (`#L125`) sits one line off the verified range (126-137); same function, no
discrepancy of substance.

**Supersession — DOES NOT HOLD.** The brief flags sibling `71258c80fce2` (DONE 2026-07-31T17:26:40Z)
as possibly already carrying the fix. It cannot: `doc_classifier`'s `origin/main` **has not moved
since 2026-07-30** (`OUT-docclf.md:8-14`, from a `.git/FETCH_HEAD` stamped 2026-08-09 12:26 — a fresh
read, not a stale tracking ref), so no landed change since the filing could satisfy anything; the
triage that re-read the claim live ran **2026-08-09, nine days after** that sibling reached DONE and
still found it true; and the sibling's own evidence line says its branch `wt-71258c80fce2` is *"NOT
landed on main"*. The same reasoning the 08-16 session applied to `c07fb00eb9b6` applies here
unchanged, and for the same governing measurement.

**Therefore `38de29ec5e59` is open, correct as filed, and unstarted.** It is blocked on *where it was
sent*, not on what it says.

## What the fix is, for whoever reaches a venue that can see it

Already specified — do not re-derive. `OUT-docclf.md:154-159` (cluster **M-P-2**, item 4 of 5 in its
order) states the DoD clause: *"`_stage_uv` fetches under `--require-hashes` against a pin the
packager does not itself author"*, `make ci` green, landed on `origin/main`. Its falsifier
(`OUT-docclf.md:161-164`) is:

```
git show origin/main:pipeline/backbone/port/build.py | sed -n '116,140p' | grep -q -- --require-hashes
```

That command is the whole verdict, and it is **unrunnable from this venue** — there is no
`doc_classifier` tree here to run it against. Note also that M-P-2 groups this item with four others
in the same file-and-surface set and gives an explicit order; a worker that reaches the right venue
should read that grouping before opening a diff, because two of the five conflict if done separately.

## Measured from inside this session

| what | value |
|---|---|
| clone | `git rev-list --count HEAD` → **50**, `.git/shallow` present |
| `HEAD` vs `origin/main` | **0 behind** — a fresh fetch succeeded; this VM *is* at `claude-infrastructure` trunk |
| `bin/cc-offload:84` on trunk | `REPO="${CC_OFFLOAD_REPO:-$ROOT}"` — **unchanged; no guard has shipped** |
| `/Users`, `~/Development`, any `doc_classifier` checkout | absent (`find / -maxdepth 4 -name doc_classifier` → 0 hits) |
| GitHub scope | `renchris/claude-infrastructure`, one repository |
| `cc-eligible check 38de29ec5e59` (fixture) | `verdict=eligible` · `named: (nothing — no spelling in the list fired)` |

The `cc-eligible` verdict is the **fifth** consecutive one and is still correct on its own terms: the
work is repo-only and names no local-only state. The gap remains the pair
(`item.project`, `session.attached_repo`), exactly as §2 of the 08-16 doc argues — nothing here
reopens the widen-the-denylist question that doc closed with a no.

## The rails fail quietly here too — reproduced, with exit codes

The brief's disposition instructions (`cc-backlog done` / `block` / `reopen`, `cc-notify --role desk`)
are laptop-shaped. `~/.claude/autonomy/` does not exist on this VM, so they **exit 0 while doing
nothing** — re-measured this session, matching the 08-17 `reso` finding:

```
$ cc-backlog done 38de29ec5e59 --evidence "…"
cc-backlog done: unknown id 38de29ec5e59                                    # rc 0

$ cc-notify --role desk "…"
cc-notify: verdict=unresolvable enqueued=0 reason=role-unset                # rc 0
```

**The ledger was NOT updated by this session and must not be reported as such.** A cloud VM's only
durable channel to the desk is the branch it pushes; this file is the notification.

## Operator actions

The §3 decision from `cloud-venue-project-repo-mismatch-2026-08-16.md` — **(a) fail closed at the
fire vs (b) route by `item.project`** — is unchanged and now carries a fifth datapoint of cost, plus
the first evidence that the cost per item is not capped at one session. Nothing new is proposed.

The ledger disposition for this item needs the Mac:

```
cc-backlog block 38de29ec5e59 --needs "re-dispatch to a session that can reach renchris/doc_classifier — a local claim, or a cloud fire whose attached git_repository source IS doc_classifier; premise CONFIRMED on origin/main and supersession by 71258c80fce2 REFUTED (docs/research/venue-foreign-repo-recurrence-2026-08-17.md § FIFTH OCCURRENCE); second cloud session burned on this item"
```

`block`, not `reopen`, and not `done`: the item is not blocked on information or on a judgment call,
it is blocked on **where it was sent**, and parking it out of the dispatch wave is what stops a sixth
fire into the same VM shape before the guard exists. Marking it `done` would be false — nothing about
`build.py` changed.

## Not fixed here, deliberately

The three refusals the 08-16 and 08-17 sessions recorded still hold verbatim and are not re-argued:
`bin/cc-offload` fires paid cloud sessions and neither `bats` nor `shellcheck` is installed here, so
the repo's gate cannot be run on a shell change; `bin/cc-eligible`'s `OFFBOX_LANE` class states that a
session this lane created cannot verify a change to the lane; and a 50-commit clone cannot adjudicate
its own admission. Landing an ungated guard into the fire path would trade a bounded waste for an
unbounded one.

**No claim is made about `build.py` beyond what `OUT-docclf.md` already verified on 2026-08-09.** The
file was never readable from this session. The premise is confirmed *by citation to a dated read of
trunk*, not by this VM re-reading it — a distinction that matters precisely because the brief's
mandated first step (read what the item cites on trunk) is unrunnable here.

# The seventh — the refusal already exists, and it can only fire where it is not needed

**2026-08-19.** Backlog item `ce7651b02a17`, project `doc_classifier`, title *"reviewapp/api/auth.py:
fresh PyJWKClient per token → pre-auth JWKS fetch amplification (medium, PoC-proven: 4 fetches from 2
rejected tokens)"*, fired into a cloud session whose one attached repository is
`renchris/claude-infrastructure`. Third distinct `doc_classifier` item, two days after the last row,
`bin/cc-offload:84` byte-unchanged. The class-level facts are not restated; three things below are new,
and the first two revise conclusions recorded above rather than adding to them.

## 1 · The eligibility side is not silent on this item — it refuses, and the refusal is unreachable

Every occurrence above concluded that `cc-eligible` reads the row as cloud-suitable *and is correct on
its own terms*, and closed the widen-the-denylist question with a no. That is right about the **keyword
lists** and it is the wrong place to have stopped looking. The file's other arm — the **history
certification**, a measurement rather than a spelling — already fires on this item:

```
$ cc-eligible why ce7651b02a17                                   # fixture, this VM
  verdict : eligible
  refused : (nothing fired)
  history : no-repo — NOT CERTIFIED: no readable git repo for this project — reach is unknown
            repo=/root/Development/doc_classifier ref=- depth=50
```

`no-repo` is one of the three states on which, per `bin/cc-eligible:86-92`, *"the GATE stays fail-open …
the PRODUCER fails closed"* — and the producer does exactly that: `bin/cc-venue:281` returns
`{"venue": "local", "token": "uncertified-history"}`. **A venue label minted from here would have been
`local`.** The guard that stops this dispatch is built, shipped and working.

It cannot fire where it is needed, and the reason is structural rather than a missing case.
`repo_for()` (`bin/cc-eligible:613-626`) resolves a project to `$HOME/Development/<project>` — a path on
**the machine doing the measuring**. On the Mac that path exists for `doc_classifier`
(`scripts/dispatch-projects.conf`: `repo=~/Development/doc_classifier`, *"verified 2026-07-29: repo
present"*; `OUT-docclf.md:3`), so the oracle reads a real, full clone, certifies reach, and the producer
promotes to `cloud`. The certification is a measurement of the **producing** filesystem being used to
predict reach on the **consuming** one, and for a foreign project those two answers are opposites by
construction: present on the box that decides, absent on the box that works.

That the path resolution — not the item's text — is what moves the verdict is measurable from here:

| resolved repo | history state |
|---|---|
| `/root/Development/doc_classifier` (absent) | `no-repo` — NOT CERTIFIED |
| `CC_ELIGIBLE_REPO=/home/user/claude-infrastructure` (present) | `shallow` — NOT CERTIFIED |

Same item text, different certification, and the only variable is which tree the oracle was pointed at.
The Mac's third answer (`reachable`, on a full clone) is **inferred** from `repo_for()`'s definition plus
the two citations above, not measured — this VM's clone is shallow, so it cannot reproduce a `reachable`
and the `shallow` guard in arm B is that refusal working as designed.

This does **not** reopen the denylist question. It relocates the fix to an arm that already exists: the
certification is sound about *reach into history* and unsound about *reach to the repo at all*, because
it never asks which repo the consuming session will attach. Both shapes on the open 08-16 decision
((a) fail closed at the fire, (b) route by `item.project`) still hold; this only shows the predicate side
is nearer to already answering than four notes have recorded, and that the missing input is
`session.attached_repo` — the same value `bin/cc-offload:84` derives from the wrong place.

**This is the third face of one generator.** `CLOUD_BACKLOG_PIPELINE.md` A2 F3 found the M2 freshness
gate refusing cloud fires *"on a staleness check about a directory the cloud session does not use"*;
`bin/cc-offload:84` attaches the firing checkout's origin rather than the item's; and the history oracle
certifies against the firing box's filesystem. Three guards, all measuring the local disk to decide
something about a remote one.

## 2 · CORRECTION — the disposition rails do **not** exit 0; they fail loudly

Both 08-17 sections record `cc-backlog` and `cc-notify` as *"exit 0 while doing nothing"*, and draw the
trap from it: *"a worker that ran them and trusted the exit code would report the item parked when it is
not."* **That does not reproduce.** Measured this session with the store absent, invoked bare:

```
$ cc-backlog block  ce7651b02a17 --needs "…"    → cc-backlog block: unknown id …    rc 3
$ cc-backlog done   ce7651b02a17 --evidence "…" → cc-backlog done: unknown id …     rc 3
$ cc-backlog reopen ce7651b02a17                → cc-backlog reopen: unknown id …   rc 3
$ cc-notify --role desk "…"                     → verdict=unresolvable enqueued=0   rc 141
                                                  + names the fix: cc-roles list
```

`bin/cc-backlog:1562` is `has_id "$id" || { …; return 3; }`. The rc-0 reading reproduces exactly, and
only, when `$?` is read after a pipe:

```
$ cc-backlog block … >/dev/null 2>&1;        echo $?   → 3
$ cc-backlog block … 2>&1 | head -1 >/dev/null; echo $?   → 0      # head's rc, not the tool's
```

Every rc quoted in the two sections above sits beside a piped, `head`-trimmed transcript. That is
consistent with a measurement artifact, and it is **not proof of one**: `63b71c0e` (2026-08-18) touched
that line, and this clone is grafted at 50 commits with its oldest reachable commit *being* `63b71c0e`,
so the pre-08-17 source is unreadable from here and the two hypotheses cannot be separated at this
venue. One command on the Mac settles it:

```
git log -L1562,1562:bin/cc-backlog --oneline | head -20
```

The operational consequence is the opposite of what is recorded above, so it is worth stating plainly:
**the rails are safe to run blind.** A worker that runs them on a VM gets a non-zero exit and a
diagnostic, not a false confirmation. The reason a cloud VM still cannot dispose of its item is that the
store is not here — not that the tools lie about it.

## 3 · The M-P-2 consolidation was decided ten days ago and never actuated

The sixth occurrence noted in passing that a worker reaching the right venue *"should read that grouping
before opening a diff, because two of the five conflict if done separately."* The dispatch record now
makes that a mechanism defect rather than advice. `OUT-docclf.md:132` groups five items — `e3d8a8cf90a4`,
`ce7651b02a17`, `38de29ec5e59`, `16319f4234a3`, `1a9f3323e4d7` — as **one effort** under one DoD, with an
explicit order in which `ce7651b02a17` is member **3**, behind a member 2 that *"must be done in one diff
or they conflict."* Two of those five have since each been dispatched as a **standalone one-item wave**:
`38de29ec5e59` on 08-17, `ce7651b02a17` today. Even a correctly-routed fire of this brief would therefore
have produced a wrong-shaped diff — a venue fix alone does not make this item workable as sent.

The ledger already ships the actuator. A `--condition` group joined with `link` gives its members a
shared **lease** that admits one at a time (`bin/cc-backlog:352`, `:525-532`), which is precisely the
constraint M-P-2 describes; `bin/cc-dispatch:1075` names *"the consolidation actuator (R6)"* as the repair
and disclaims it as out of scope for that file. Nothing joined these five. This is the same diode the
§"the conclusion never reached the enforcing store" finding names for the venue fix, arriving
independently: the consolidation is **plan prose**, and nothing in the dispatch chain reads plan prose.

## Measured from inside this session

| what | value |
|---|---|
| clone | `git rev-list --count HEAD` → **50**, `.git/shallow` present, oldest reachable commit `63b71c0e` (2026-08-18) |
| `HEAD` vs `origin/main` | **0 behind** — fresh fetch succeeded |
| `bin/cc-offload:84` | `REPO="${CC_OFFLOAD_REPO:-$ROOT}"` — **unchanged; no guard has shipped** (3 days after the decision was filed) |
| `/Users`, `~/Development`, any `doc_classifier` checkout | absent (`find / -maxdepth 4 -name doc_classifier` → 0 hits) |
| GitHub scope | `renchris/claude-infrastructure`, one repository — and `renchris/doc_classifier` exists (`OUT-docclf.md:3`) but is out of scope, so it cannot be cloned from here either |
| `cc-eligible check ce7651b02a17` (fixture) | `verdict=eligible` · `refused: (nothing fired)` · `history: no-repo` |

## The item itself — NOT adjudicated

No claim is made about `reviewapp/api/auth.py` by this session, and none should be inferred. The premise
is **confirmed by citation to a dated read of trunk** — `OUT-docclf.md:49` verified on `origin/main`
@ `cc6a30a6` that `jwt.PyJWKClient(settings.jwks_url, cache_keys=True).get_signing_key_from_jwt(...)` is
constructed inline per token at `auth.py:73`, and that `cache_keys=True` caches only within a throwaway
instance — not by this VM re-reading it. The brief's own mandated first step is unrunnable here for the
reason the fourth occurrence already gave: there is no tree, stale or otherwise. Whether the fix has
landed since 2026-07-30 is unknown from this venue; `OUT-docclf.md:163` carries the falsifier, and it
needs a `doc_classifier` checkout to run.

## Operator actions

The §3 decision from `cloud-venue-project-repo-mismatch-2026-08-16.md` — **(a) fail closed at the fire vs
(b) route by `item.project`** — is unchanged and now carries a seventh datapoint. §1 above adds one input
to it: the predicate side already computes the right answer when pointed at the consuming machine, so
whichever shape is chosen, `session.attached_repo` is the value both `bin/cc-offload:84` and
`cc-eligible`'s `repo_for()` are missing.

Two ledger dispositions need the Mac. First, this item:

```
cc-backlog block ce7651b02a17 --needs "re-dispatch to a session that can reach renchris/doc_classifier — a local claim, or a cloud fire whose attached git_repository source IS doc_classifier; AND dispatch it as part of M-P-2, not standalone (OUT-docclf.md:132 puts it 3rd of 5 behind a member that must share a diff); premise CONFIRMED by citation only (docs/research/venue-foreign-repo-recurrence-2026-08-17.md § SEVENTH)"
```

Second, the grouping — the thing that stops members 4 and 5 being fired standalone next:

```
for i in e3d8a8cf90a4 ce7651b02a17 38de29ec5e59 16319f4234a3 1a9f3323e4d7; do cc-backlog link "$i" --condition mp-two-axis-separation-docclf; done
```

*(Signature checked against the source, not assumed: `link` takes **one** id per call
(`bin/cc-backlog:48`, `cmd_link` at `:2690-2715`), hence the loop; and the slug carries **no digit** —
`cmd_link` rejects digits outright, "a slug carrying a measurement mints one GROUP per measurement",
and its own error text prescribes spelling the numeral out. `mp2-…` would have exited 2. The group
semantics — one lease, one live member — are at `:352` and `:525-532`. Not exercised here: there is no
store on this VM, so this is a read of the code, not a dry run.)*

## Not fixed here, deliberately

The three standing refusals hold verbatim and are not re-argued: `bin/cc-offload` fires paid cloud
sessions and neither `bats` nor `shellcheck` is installed here, so the repo's gate cannot be run on a
shell change; `bin/cc-eligible`'s `OFFBOX_LANE` class states that a session this lane created cannot
verify a change to the lane; and a 50-commit clone cannot adjudicate its own admission. §1 identifies a
placement inside `bin/cc-eligible`, which is squarely inside that third refusal — it is written as a
finding for the open decision, not as a patch withheld.
