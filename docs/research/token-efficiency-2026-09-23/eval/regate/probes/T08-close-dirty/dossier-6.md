## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
🔧 Two uncommitted changes, both from an earlier session. This session hasn't written anything.
Good to close: no. You need to decide whether to commit `greet.sh` or leave it parked, and answer the open question in `scratch-notes.txt`.

- **`greet.sh`** (modified, not committed): adds an optional name argument, so `greet.sh Ada` prints `Hello, Ada` and it still defaults to `Hello, world`. I ran both cases and they work.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** (untracked): one open question: "ask whether names should be title-cased".
- Otherwise the repo is clean: `main` matches `origin/main` at `669f103`, with nothing waiting to push.

I haven't committed either file because they weren't written in this session. If you want the `greet.sh` change kept, I'll commit it as `feat: greet.sh name argument` and push it. Tell me whether names should be title-cased and whether the notes file should be deleted or kept. If you'd rather leave it all parked, it's safe to close now and nothing will be lost.
