# Dossier

## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
**Not quite.** Nothing from this session is open, but the working tree has two uncommitted changes from an earlier session. Closing won't delete them, but they aren't saved in git. `main` itself is in sync with `origin/main`.

- **`greet.sh`** now takes an optional name: `greet.sh Ada` prints "Hello, Ada", and with no name it still prints "Hello, world". I ran it both ways and both work.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** is untracked and holds one open question: "should names be title-cased?" It's a note rather than code, so it probably shouldn't be committed.

I left both alone because I didn't write them, and I don't commit another session's work without asking.

Good to close: no — `greet.sh` is still uncommitted. It's yours to decide: if you say "commit greet.sh", I'll commit it on its own as `feat: greet.sh name argument` and push it to `origin`. If you'd rather keep it uncommitted, it's safe to close now.
