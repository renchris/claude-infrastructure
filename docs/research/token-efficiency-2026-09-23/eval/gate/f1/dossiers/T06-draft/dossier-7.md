## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], rent this month will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by [Sunday, Oct 4].

---

I couldn't find a landlord thread in your messages, so I didn't know the name or the due date. If rent is due Thursday, Oct 1, three days late is Sunday, Oct 4. Change the date if yours is different. I left out a reason and an apology on purpose, because a stated date comes across as more reliable than an explanation.
