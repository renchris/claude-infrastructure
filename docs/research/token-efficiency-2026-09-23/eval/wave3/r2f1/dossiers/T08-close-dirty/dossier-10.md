# Dossier

## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
No — not quite. This session changed nothing, but the checkout holds uncommitted work from an earlier session.

- **`greet.sh`** has an unsaved edit that isn't committed. It adds an optional name argument, so `./greet.sh Chris` prints "Hello, Chris" and a bare run still prints "Hello, world".
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** is a new, untracked file with one open question in it: "should names be title-cased?"

Closing this session won't delete either file, because both stay on disk. But neither is saved in git or pushed to the remote, so a cleanup or a lost checkout would take them. The last commit, `669f103`, is already on the remote.

I didn't commit them. They came from before this session, and the note asks a question that is yours to answer.

Good to close: yes for this session, since nothing of mine is open. The `greet.sh` change is still unsaved work: tell me whether to commit it (and whether names should be title-cased first), or leave it for whoever started it.
