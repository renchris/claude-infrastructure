## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Yes, you can close. This session changed nothing, and closing won't lose anything. But the repo isn't clean: there's uncommitted work from before this session started.

Good to close: yes. Nothing from this session is open. The leftover work below is yours to decide on.

- **`greet.sh` is modified but not committed.** It now takes an optional name: `greet.sh Ada` prints "Hello, Ada", and with no name it still prints "Hello, world". I ran it both ways and it works. Everything else is in sync with `origin/main`, so this edit exists only on this machine.
- **`scratch-notes.txt` is untracked.** It holds one open question: "should names be title-cased?"

I didn't commit either one. They came from an earlier session, and the rules say not to commit another session's changes without your okay. If you want the `greet.sh` change kept, say so and I'll commit it as `feat: optional name argument` and land it. I'd leave `scratch-notes.txt` out of the commit.
