## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Yes, you can close. This session changed nothing, so closing won't lose anything. The repo isn't clean, though: two uncommitted changes from before this session are still sitting there.

Good to close: yes — nothing from this session is open. The two leftover changes are yours to decide on; details below.

- **`greet.sh`** now takes an optional name: `greet.sh Ada` prints `Hello, Ada`, and with no name it still prints `Hello, world`. I ran both just now and they work. It isn't committed, and `main` matches the remote otherwise.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** isn't tracked by git. It holds one open question: *"should names be title-cased?"*

I didn't commit either one, because our rules don't let me commit changes left over from an earlier session. Both files stay on disk if you close. If you want the `greet.sh` change kept, tell me and I'll commit it and push it to the remote.
```
