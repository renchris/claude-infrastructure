## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [name], this month's rent will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by Sunday, October 4.

---

This assumes rent is due on the 1st. If it's due on a different day, change the date. I searched your messages for "rent" and didn't find a thread with your landlord. The recent hits were about moving and apartment hunting. So add their name, and check the thread for anything that changes the wording, like a late fee they've already brought up. The text gives no reason, because this kind of notice doesn't need one.
