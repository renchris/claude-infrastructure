## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], October's rent will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by Sunday, October 4.

---

I assumed rent is due on the 1st. If it's due on a different day, change the date to 3 days after that. I didn't find a text thread with a landlord in your messages, so I left the name blank. I also left out a reason and an apology on purpose, because giving one makes it sound like you're asking permission.
