## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], this month's rent will be 3 days late. It will be paid in full by [weekday, date].

---

I didn't write a reason, because a reason makes a routine notice sound unusual. The message also doesn't ask whether being late is okay. It tells them when the rent will be paid, since that part is up to you.

I couldn't tell who your current landlord is. Your texts show the Irvine Company lease ending and you moving to Texas, but I didn't find a thread with a new landlord, so I left the name blank. If rent is due on the 1st, 3 days late would be Sunday, October 4.

Good to close: yes — follow-on: none.
