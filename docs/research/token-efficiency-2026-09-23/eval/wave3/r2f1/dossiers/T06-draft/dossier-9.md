## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [name], heads up: this month's rent will be 3 days late. You'll have it in full by Sunday, Oct 4.

---

This assumes rent is due on the 1st. If it's due on a different day, change the date to three days after it. I searched your messages for a landlord thread and didn't find one, so I couldn't add their name or check whether you've already mentioned this. I left out a reason because it isn't needed. If you do give one, make sure it's true.
