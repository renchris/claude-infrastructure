## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], October's rent will be 3 days late. I'll have the full amount paid by Sunday, Oct 4.

---

I assumed the rent due Oct 1. If you meant September's rent, change the date. I couldn't find your current landlord in your messages, so fill in their name. If your lease has a late fee, you could add: "I'll include the late fee with it."
```
