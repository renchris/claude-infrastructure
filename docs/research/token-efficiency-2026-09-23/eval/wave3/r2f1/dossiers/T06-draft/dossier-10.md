## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [name], this month's rent will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by Sunday, Oct 4.

---

I assumed rent is due Thursday, Oct 1. If it's due on a different day, change the date. I searched your messages and couldn't find a thread with your landlord, so check this against anything you've already told them. There's also an automated rent-update number in your history (+1 949-365-4705), which suggests a property manager with a payment portal. If that's who collects rent, they may want a heads-up through the portal instead of a text.
