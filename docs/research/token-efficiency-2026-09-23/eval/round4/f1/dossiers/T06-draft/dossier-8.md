## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [name], this month's rent will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by [weekday, date].

---

I couldn't find a landlord thread in your messages. Your texts suggest you might be staying with a friend in Austin, so I didn't guess who this goes to or what the rent is. Fill in the date as the day rent is due plus 3 days. For example, if it's due Thursday Oct 1, that's Sunday Oct 4. I didn't include a reason, because an unasked reason makes the late payment sound like a bigger deal. If your lease has a late fee or grace period, send me the name or number and I'll read the thread and adjust the text.
