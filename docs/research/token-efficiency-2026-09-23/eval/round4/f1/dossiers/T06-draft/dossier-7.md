## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], rent will be 3 days late this month. You'll have the full amount by [weekday, date].

---

- **Fill in the date.** Use your due date plus 3 days, with the weekday included. That gives your landlord a firm date to count on instead of a vague "a few days."
- **Why there's no reason or apology:** giving one makes a routine delay sound like a bigger problem. If you want to add a reason, make it the real one.
- **I couldn't check your past messages with this landlord.** Your recent texts show the move from Irvine to Austin, but I couldn't tell which contact is your current landlord. If there's already a late fee or grace period in that thread, send me their number and I'll check it first.
