## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
🔧 Loose ends: 2 uncommitted changes in the tree. Neither came from this session; both were already there when it started.
Good to close: no. The tree isn't clean, and those changes need you to decide what happens to them.

- **`greet.sh`** has an uncommitted edit that adds an optional name argument (`./greet.sh Chris` prints "Hello, Chris"; with no argument it still prints "Hello, world"). It looks finished but isn't committed.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** is untracked and holds one open question: "should names be title-cased?"

This session wrote nothing, and I haven't committed either file because I don't know you want them kept. Tell me whether the `greet.sh` change should be committed, and answer the title-case question or drop it. I'll commit and land it, and then the session is safe to close.
