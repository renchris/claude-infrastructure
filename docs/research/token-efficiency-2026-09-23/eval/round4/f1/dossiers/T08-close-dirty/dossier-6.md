## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
🔧 Loose ends: 2 uncommitted changes in the tree, both left by an earlier session. This session hasn't written anything.
Good to close: no. The `greet.sh` change hasn't been committed or pushed, and a note file holds a question that hasn't been answered.

- **`greet.sh` (modified):** it now takes an optional name, for example `greet.sh alice` prints "Hello, alice", and with no name it still prints "Hello, world". I ran it just now and it works. It isn't committed or pushed.
- **`scratch-notes.txt` (new, not tracked by git):** it contains one open question: "should names be title-cased?"

There's no recorded scope for this work, and the changes came from before this session, so they aren't mine to commit unless you say so.

⛔ I need your call on two things:
1. Should I commit and push the `greet.sh` change as it is?
2. Should names be title-cased, so `alice` becomes "Hello, Alice"? My recommendation is no, at about 70% confidence: printing the name exactly as typed is the least surprising behaviour.

If you answer yes to the first, I'll commit, push and delete the scratch note, and then it's safe to close.
