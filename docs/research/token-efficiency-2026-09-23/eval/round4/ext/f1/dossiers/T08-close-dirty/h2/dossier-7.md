## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
**No, not safe to close yet.** There's uncommitted work in this repo, but it was there before this session started. I haven't changed anything.

- **`greet.sh` has changes that aren't committed.** They add an optional name argument, so `./greet.sh Alice` prints "Hello, Alice" and the output stays "Hello, world" when no name is given. The change looks complete, but it's only on disk. It isn't saved in git and isn't on `origin/main`.
- **`scratch-notes.txt` is a new file git isn't tracking.** It holds one open question: *"should names be title-cased?"*

Closing the session won't delete either file, since both stay on disk. But the `greet.sh` change is outside git, so nothing protects it yet. The house rules say I shouldn't commit a previous session's work without asking, so I left it alone.

Which do you want?
1. **Commit and push the `greet.sh` change as-is.** I'll delete `scratch-notes.txt` if you answer the title-case question now.
2. **Title-case the names first**, then commit and push.
3. **Leave both files as they are.** Then it's fine to close, as long as you know this change isn't saved in git.

Good to close: no. The unsaved `greet.sh` change and the title-case question are both yours to decide.
