## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], October rent will be 3 days late. You'll have the full amount by Sunday, October 4.

---
- **Dates:** I assumed this is October rent, due Thursday, Oct 1. If it's September rent, change it to "September rent" and whatever date you'll actually pay.
- **Who it goes to:** your texts show you moved to Austin in late August and planned to stay on a couch before signing a lease. None of them show a current landlord, so I didn't check this against an existing conversation with them. Fill in their name.
- **No reason given, on purpose:** a reason makes a routine request sound unusual. If your lease charges a late fee after a grace period, that clause applies whatever the text says.
