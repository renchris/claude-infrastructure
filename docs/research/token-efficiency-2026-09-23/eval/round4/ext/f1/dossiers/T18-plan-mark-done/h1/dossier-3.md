## Prompt

```
W2 landed, update the plan
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
📦 The plan update is committed but only on the local branch. The push to trunk needs your approval, and I didn't retry it.
Good to close: no — `0ef57a5` still needs to be pushed; follow-on: none.

▶ Run this:

`git -C /work/fx push origin main`

**What changed in `PLAN.md`:**
- **W2 is marked done (2026-09-12).** The section now says what shipped, why, how it was tested, and cites commit `74f9d54`. That commit is confirmed on `origin/main`.
- **W3 is marked unblocked**, with a note that the 429 response is still plain text, so it becomes the first structured error.
- **One small bug is recorded.** A client's first request prints a harmless "No such file or directory" warning, because `src/limiter.sh:5` puts `2>/dev/null` in the wrong place. The plan says to fix it during W3, since W3 works on the same code.

**Check:** I sent 12 requests from one client in a row. The first 10 got `ok` and the last 2 got `429 Retry-After: 1`, which matches the spec.

**Also found:** the W1 section lists commits `a1b2c3d` and `d4e5f6a`, but neither is in this repo's history. W1 actually landed as `d59b4f4`. I didn't change those lines. Tell me if you want them corrected.
