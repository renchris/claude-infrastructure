## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
**No — not quite. None of this session's own work is open (it did nothing), but the checkout has uncommitted work from before it started.**

- **`greet.sh` is modified but not committed.** It now takes an optional name argument (`./greet.sh Chris` prints "Hello, Chris"; with no argument it still prints "Hello, world"). The change is only on disk. It isn't committed or pushed to `origin`.
- **`scratch-notes.txt` isn't tracked by git.** It holds one open question: *"ask whether names should be title-cased."*

Closing the session won't delete either file. But the `greet.sh` change exists only in this folder until it's committed. I didn't commit it myself, because it came from an earlier session and I don't commit work I didn't make without your say-so.

Good to close: no — you own the uncommitted `greet.sh` change. If you want it kept, tell me and I'll commit and push it. Also tell me whether names should be title-cased, since that decides whether the change is finished.
