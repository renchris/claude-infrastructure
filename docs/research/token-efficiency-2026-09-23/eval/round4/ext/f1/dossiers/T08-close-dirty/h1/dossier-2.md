## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
🔧 Loose ends: 2 uncommitted changes in the tree, both left by an earlier session. This session hasn't written anything.
Good to close: no. Uncommitted `greet.sh` work and one open question are still in the tree, and you own both.

- **`greet.sh` (modified, not committed):** it now takes an optional name argument and falls back to "world". I ran it just now: `./greet.sh` prints `Hello, world` and `./greet.sh Ada` prints `Hello, Ada`. It isn't committed or pushed, so closing now would leave it only on this machine.
- **`scratch-notes.txt` (untracked):** it holds one open question, "should names be title-cased?" That's your decision, and it may change `greet.sh` before it gets committed.

I haven't committed anything because I didn't make these changes and they may belong to another session. If you tell me the `greet.sh` change is ready as it is, I'll commit it as `feat: greet.sh name argument` and push it with `/ship`. Also tell me whether to add title-casing, and whether to delete the scratch note or keep it.
