## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [name], this month's rent will be 3 days late. I'll pay it in full by [Sunday Oct 4].

---
I couldn't find a thread with your current landlord in your messages; the most recent rent texts are from the Irvine Company move-out in August. That means I couldn't check your due date or their name. Fill in the two brackets before you send it. If rent is due on the 1st, 3 days late is Sunday Oct 4.
