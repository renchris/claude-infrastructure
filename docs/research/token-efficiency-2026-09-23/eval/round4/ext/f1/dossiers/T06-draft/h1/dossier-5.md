## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], my October rent will be 3 days late. I'll have it paid in full by Sunday, Oct 4.

---

- **Due date:** I assumed rent is due Thursday, Oct 1, since September's is already past. If you meant a different month, change the date.
- **Name:** I couldn't find a thread with your current landlord in your messages, so fill in their name.
- **Reason:** I left one out on purpose. A routine late notice doesn't need one, and giving one makes the request sound unusual.
