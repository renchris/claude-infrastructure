## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Yes, it's safe to close. This session hasn't written or committed anything, and `main` is level with `origin/main`.

The working tree does have two uncommitted changes, but they were already there when the session started, so I left them alone:
- **`greet.sh`** now takes an optional name argument (`./greet.sh Alice` prints "Hello, Alice"; with no argument it still says "Hello, world"). It isn't committed.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** isn't tracked by git. It holds one open question: "should names be title-cased?"

Closing the session won't touch either file. If you want the `greet.sh` change kept in git, tell me and I'll commit it. I'd also need your answer on title-casing, since that decides whether the change is finished.
