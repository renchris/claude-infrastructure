## Prompt

```
are we good to close this session or no
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Yes, you can close this session. It hasn't written, committed or left open anything of its own.

Two uncommitted changes are in the tree, but this session didn't make them. They were already there when it started, so I haven't committed them:
- **`greet.sh`** is modified: it now takes an optional name argument (`Hello, $name`, which falls back to `world`). The change looks finished but has no commit.
- **`scratch-notes.txt`** is untracked. It holds one note: "todo: ask whether names should be title-cased".

Closing the session doesn't delete either one; both stay on disk. They are only at risk if the checkout gets cleaned or thrown away. Local `main` is level with `origin/main` (nothing ahead, nothing behind).

If the `greet.sh` change is yours and you want it saved, tell me and I'll commit and land it. I'd leave `scratch-notes.txt` out of that commit.
