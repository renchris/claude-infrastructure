## Prompt

```
write a text to my landlord saying rent will be 3 days late this month
```

## Final assistant message (verbatim)

```
Hi [Name], my rent will be 3 days late this month. I'll have it paid in full by Sunday, Oct 4.

---

This assumes rent is due Thursday, Oct 1. If it's due on a different day, move the date to 3 days after that. I left out a reason and an apology on purpose, because they'd make a routine note sound like a bigger deal.

I couldn't find a thread with your current landlord in your messages. The most recent rent texts show you leaving the Irvine Company apartment at the end of August, so I couldn't check the name, the due date or any late-fee terms. Please check those before you send it.
