# Computer vision for 100th-percentile web design review

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Machine:** Apple M1 Max, 64 GB unified, 32-core GPU
**Question:** what tooling gives our Claude Code sessions genuine visual understanding — spatial
recognition, not image-to-text OCR — so we can run 100th-percentile design review of
`reso-management-app`, `reso-web-app` and `reso-landing-app`? Local models for this Mac, and
cloud/API, on the pattern of Parakeet/Whisper-v3-Turbo locally and the Mistral OCR API in the cloud.

**Method:** 15 parallel research agents (reports in `agents/`) plus a purpose-built ground-truth
defect corpus measured three ways on this machine (`../../../bench/`). Where the agents and the
bench disagree, the bench wins; where agents disagree with each other, both are named.

---

## The answer

**Buy pixels and an eval, not models.** Perception is not our binding constraint, and the analogy to
Parakeet and Mistral OCR does not transfer. Speech recognition and OCR are narrow tasks with crisp
ground truth, high volume, and open models that genuinely match or beat hosted ones. Design critique
has none of those properties. What we are short of is not a better eye — it is (a) the discipline of
never asking a model to compute what the browser already knows, (b) any acceptance test at all, and
(c) a settled decision about what the review is *for*, which we made in June 2026 and then lost.

Three measurements, all taken on this machine today, carry the argument:

| Detector | DOM-determined | Pixels-only | False positives on the clean control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic rules** (~250 lines, 80 ms/page) | **9 / 9** | 0 / 2 (1 honest abstention) | **0** |
| **DOM-vs-pixels cross-check** (~180 lines NumPy, no model) | — | **1 / 2** → **2 / 3** ‡ | **0** |
| **Claude vision, blind** (8 pages, no ground truth) | 2 / 4 | **2 / 2** | **0** |
| **Local `Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`** (MLX, this Mac) | not run | 1 of 3 resolutions correct | invented a defect at 2 of 3 resolutions |

**The union of the first three is 11 of 11**, and each covers precisely what the others cannot. That
complementarity *is* the architecture. The fourth row is why no local model is in it.

⚠️ **This table is a correction.** The first version scored three pixels-only defects and reported
6 of 7. Building the cross-check exposed the reason: the `optical-centering` variant injected an
*empty* CSS rule, so its render was **SHA-256 identical to the control**. It was a null test item, and
both the deterministic layer and the blind reviewer were *right* to report nothing on it — I had
scored a correct abstention as a miss, against both. The corpus now injects a real delta (the base
carries optical compensation; the variant removes it), and the honest population is 9 DOM-determined
plus 2 pixels-only. **A corpus needs its own control run before it is allowed to grade anything**, and
mine did not get one until a third detector disagreed with it.

‡ **Superseded on 2026-09-03 by a re-measurement, and the earlier cell was passing by luck.** The
cross-check's `1 / 2` is scored here against the two pixels-only defects the run treated as
scoreable; re-run against the corpus's own declared population of **three**, with the checks fixed,
it is **2 / 3** — and the third is `hierarchy-inversion`, which is a judgement rather than a
measurement and is the vision layer's by design. More importantly the original `1` was not
reproducible: the arm that scored it depended on a modal-colour background that is undefined on a
gradient, and it returns **0 / 3** on a machine whose font rasteriser rounds the other way. Both
halves are in §3.1 below.

---

## 1. What we measured, and why it settles more than the literature does

The corpus (`bench/corpus/build_corpus.py`) renders one realistic dashboard thirteen ways: a clean
control plus twelve variants, each carrying exactly one injected defect at a known location with a
known magnitude. Nine defects are fully determined by the DOM. Three are invisible to it *by
construction* — the computed styles are correct and the rendering is still wrong.

That split is the whole instrument. It is the same shape as **DiffSpot** (arXiv 2605.29615, May
2026), which mutates one CSS property, re-renders, and asks what changed — and on which the best of
thirteen models scores **47.2%**, with hard-tier recall below 23% for every model and `line-height`
median recall at **4.0%**. We reproduced that difficulty independently.

**Three findings the corpus produced that no report predicted:**

**The "clean" control was not clean.** The first run flagged four defects on the hand-authored
baseline. Three were real WCAG failures I had written myself without noticing — white on blue-600 is
3.68:1, blue-100 on blue-600 is 3.01:1, both under the 4.5:1 floor. A deterministic linter earned its
keep before it ever saw an injected defect. (Fixed by moving to blue-700: 6.70:1 and 5.49:1.)

**Deduplicating findings by `(rule, target)` silently swallowed a real defect.** The colour-token
drift on the primary button was suppressed because an unrelated `token-drift` finding already existed
on that same element in the baseline. The key has to span the claim, not just its location — the
`assertion-span-must-equal-its-subject` failure, reproduced live. It scored 0/1 until fixed, then 1/1.

**Claude's blind review found three real defects nobody injected and no rule was looking for:** a
table caption promising grey rows that do not exist, an unlabelled icon button with the smallest hit
target on the page, and numeric columns left-aligned so the digits do not line up. None is reachable
by any rule I wrote, because none is a *violation* — each is a judgement about whether the page makes
sense. **That is the capability that cannot be replaced, and it is the one the deterministic layer
cannot grow into.**

### The local model, measured

No M1 Max VLM benchmark exists in public — A2 searched and found every fast Apple-Silicon number is
M4 Pro/Max or M5. So here is one, on the hierarchy-inversion page, `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`
(released 2026-08-14), 16.1 GB resident, cold vision encode every row because a review loop never
shows the same screenshot twice:

| Input width | Megapixels | Image tokens | Wall clock | Prefill | Decode | Peak GPU | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2560 px | 4.61 | ~1456 | **65.8 s** | 78.4 t/s | 16.7 t/s | 19.6 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |
| **1344 px** | **1.27** | ~396 | **30.2 s** | 78.6 t/s | 12.3 t/s | 19.0 GB | **correct** |
| 1024 px | 0.74 | ~225 | **21.1 s** | 66.2 t/s | 12.6 t/s | 18.1 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |

Two things fall out. **Accuracy is non-monotonic in resolution with a sweet spot near 1 MP**, which
independently reproduces mlx-vlm#1175 (mean IoU 0.542 at 12.8 MP → 0.736 at 1 MP) on different
hardware and a different task. And **the failure mode is a confident false positive** — at two of
three resolutions it named a misalignment that is not in the page. A detector that invents defects is
worse than no detector, because an agent *acts* on them.

21–66 s per screenshot also settles the interactivity question: this is a batch tool, not a loop
participant.

---

## 2. The architecture: three substrates, and never mix up which answers what

| Substrate | Answers | Never ask it |
|---|---|---|
| **Computed styles / CDP box model** | every question with a number in the answer — spacing, alignment, contrast against a solid backdrop, overflow, target size, token conformance, animation duration and easing | whether it looks good |
| **Accessibility tree** | semantic conformance, element identity, attribution back to source | anything perceptual — a perfectly valid a11y tree coexists with text overlap and occlusion |
| **Pixels (a frontier VLM)** | hierarchy, attention, "does this page make sense", contrast over a gradient, anything where the styles are right and the render is wrong | any number |

The governing rule, from A4 and confirmed by the bench: **the grounder supplies identity, the DOM
supplies geometry.** A model-produced bounding box is a 68-mAP estimate of something
`getBoundingClientRect()` returns exactly, for free, with no hallucination risk. Forbid the judge from
computing any distance from a box a model drew.

An agent using one substrate has a *silent* blind spot — it emits a confident clean report. That is
the most dangerous failure mode available to us and it is why the split is the architecture rather
than an optimisation.

### The seam, made explicit

The deterministic layer's most valuable output is not a finding, it is an **abstention**. On the
gradient-backdrop page it returns `contrast-indeterminate: cannot compute a ratio, backdrop is an
image/gradient — requirement 4.5:1 is UNVERIFIED for this text`, rather than a pass. Every silent
pass that should have been an abstention is a defect shipped. The abstention set is exactly the
vision layer's job queue, and it is small, which is what makes the vision spend affordable.

**Use `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot`, and do not let it delete that abstention.** A7 found the call
returns the compositor's own *blended* background colour per text run — the correct contrast operand,
which every JS ancestor-walk (including this bench's first version) merely approximates. Measured here:
**7.8 ms**, populated for 31 of 83 layout nodes, and it correctly resolves alpha and layered backdrops.
It is also 29× faster than the in-page `getComputedStyle` loop most tooling uses and 177× faster than
the per-node CDP walk, and the entire fact-pack serialises to ~854 tokens — *less than a screenshot*.
There is no context-budget argument for withholding facts from the judge.

But it samples **one** colour per text run, and on our gradient page it returned `rgb(30, 58, 138)` —
the gradient's leftmost stop:

| Sample point | Contrast vs white | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| left stop `#1E3A8A` — **what CDP reported** | **10.36:1** | PASS |
| mid `#3B82F6` | 3.68:1 | FAIL |
| right `#DBEAFE` — where the text actually sits | **1.22:1** | FAIL |

A nine-point swing across a single text run, and the scalar reports the passing end. **Adopting the
blended colour naively converts an honest `INDETERMINATE` into a confident false PASS, which is
strictly worse** — an abstention routes to the vision layer, a pass routes nowhere. This is the
fail-safe-default-mimics-the-healthy-state trap, and it would have been invisible: the rule gets
*better* on solid and layered backdrops at the same moment it goes blind on varying ones.

The rule that survives both findings: **take the blended colour, and keep the abstention whenever the
resolved backdrop chain contains a gradient or an image**, because no scalar can represent a backdrop
that varies across the element it sits on.

### The third layer: measure the DISAGREEMENT, not either side

A5's sharpest claim is that the high-value defects live in the *gap* between the two descriptions
rather than in either one, and that the cross-check is therefore the thing to build first — about 200
lines of NumPy, no model, no GPU. Built it (`bench/detect_xcheck.py`) and it holds. It is not a third
detector; it is a comparator that fires only where the DOM's claim and the rendered pixels disagree by
more than a stated tolerance, which means it needs no aesthetic judgement and no learned model.

The validated arm settles the gradient case that the scalar could not:

```
contrast-on-gradient
  [xcheck-contrast-varies] contrast is not one number across this text: 4.81:1 at
  the left edge and 1.57:1 at the right. Any single computed value is a fiction,
  and the right end is the one that fails a reader.
```

Sampling the backdrop separately in the left and right thirds turns "unrepresentable" into two
numbers and a verdict — no VLM call, no abstention, zero findings on the control. **That moves
contrast-over-a-gradient out of the vision layer's queue entirely.**

🚨 **The centroid arm was PROVISIONAL and shipped disabled** (`--x2` to enable), because trying to
validate it found two defects in it, and both are instances of the exact failure this document warns
about — a plausible number nobody checked. (a) It compares ink to the element's **own** box, and
`getBoundingClientRect` returns the *post*-transform box, so a `translate` moves box and ink together
and the measured offset is **invariant under the very compensation it is supposed to verify**. (b) Its
background is the crop's modal colour, so on a round button the square crop's corners — page
background outside the circle — count as ink and swamp a 16px glyph. Both fixes are known (measure
against the container; mask to the painted shape) and neither is done. Shipping it on would have
handed the pipeline a confident number with no ground truth behind it.

✅ **Both are fixed and X2 now ships enabled; `--x2` is retired** (2026-09-03, `6783abf2`). The
diagnosis above was right and incomplete — the same root cause was live in the two arms that were
already ON. §3.1 has the measurement.

### 3.1 The perception pipeline, built and measured (2026-09-03)

Four things were outstanding from §8: the abstention router, the X2 fix, a false-positive budget that
actually runs, and per-app weightings. All four are in `bench/`. What follows is what the build
measured, and the first item is a correction to this document rather than an addition.

**Every check in the cross-check estimated its own background, and that one line was wrong in three
places.** "Background" was the crop's **modal colour**; everything else was ink. A modal colour is
*undefined on a gradient* — a smooth gradient across a 1168px element is ~1168 distinct colours at 16
occurrences each, while the text drawn on top is **one** colour repeated thousands of times, so the
mode of a gradient band **is the text**. Measured on this corpus's own gradient page, the validated
arm sampled `#FFFFFF` as the backdrop of white text, computed 1.00:1 against 1.38:1 across the run,
and said nothing about the single defect it was written to catch. **The committed macOS run fired
only because that platform's font rasteriser tipped the mode the other way.** The `1 / 2` in the
headline table was a real observation of a check that was passing by luck on one machine, which is
the same class of finding as the empty-CSS null item above and was found the same way — by building
the next layer and watching it disagree.

The same inversion made the zero-ink arm **fail open**: with the text as "background", the gradient
counted as ink and it reported 98% coverage for an element it could not see at all. A check that
fails open is worse than an absent one, because it occupies the slot.

So nothing estimates a background any more. **The DOM already states the operand exactly, for free,
with no hallucination risk** — `styles.color` for text, `background-color` for a painted container.
Ink is what matches the declared foreground; the backdrop is the **median** of what does not. Median
is defined on a gradient; mode is not. This is the same rule as *the grounder supplies identity, the
DOM supplies geometry*, applied one level down to colour.

**The X2 fix is falsifiable, and it was falsified.** Measuring against the **container** (which does
not carry the child's transform) and masking to the **painted shape** (the container's fill, span-
filled to close the hole the glyph punches in it) makes the horizontal offset read **+0.16px** with
the corpus's optical compensation and **−1.84px** with it removed — a 2.0px swing that is exactly the
`translate(2px, 2px)` the defect variant deletes. The old code read *the same number for both*, which
is what defect (a) predicted and what nobody had checked.

**X2 returns a verdict on the horizontal axis only, and that is a statement about what is knowable.**
Horizontally the inline box is centred and a glyph's advance is symmetric about it, so residual ink
asymmetry can only come from the glyph's own shape — which is precisely what optical centring
compensates and what no DOM API reports. Vertically, ink sits where the **baseline** puts it, and the
browser sets the baseline from the typeface's ascent and descent, so the correct offset is a property
of the *font* and a single page holds no reference that could supply it. Measured: the same glyph
reads **dy = +3.37px on the clean control** under Liberation Sans, because the corpus's 2px constant
was calibrated against Helvetica's rasterisation of U+25B6. A verdict on that axis would have been a
false positive on the control on this machine and a pass on the author's. The offset is reported as
an observation carrying no verdict, and the finding text says so.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Pixels-only defects caught by the cross-check alone | 1 of 3 (0 of 3 on this machine) | **2 of 3** |
| Findings on the clean control, every arm enabled | 2 (X2, both false) | **0** |
| X2 status | disabled behind `--x2` | **enabled** |

The third pixels-only defect is `hierarchy-inversion`, which is a judgement rather than a measurement
and is the vision layer's by design. **Deterministic + cross-check is 11 of 12 with no model at all.**

**The router's headline number is a zero.** `bench/route.py` runs the cheap layers first and turns the
`INDETERMINATE` set into a cropped queue — but first it **subtracts what the cross-check has already
settled**. Both `contrast-indeterminate` findings on the gradient page are answered by
`xcheck-contrast-varies` on the same two elements, so **tier 1 of the vision queue is empty across the
whole 13-page corpus**. §3's claim that the comparator moves contrast-over-a-gradient out of the
vision layer's queue entirely now has a number behind it, and it is the argument for building the
comparator before buying any pixels.

The queue's two tiers differ in epistemic status, not depth: **tier 1** is an abstention (a rule ran
on this exact element and returned INDETERMINATE), **tier 2** is a standing per-app question the
deterministic layer cannot answer by construction. Tier 2 is derived from no finding and asserts
nothing, which is why the budget exempts it. Crops come from `getBoundingClientRect` via the snapshot,
padded for context and clamped to the 2576px tier so the API cannot silently undo the crop. **The
router does not call a model** — it writes a queue and the crops and stops; taste stays human (§7).

**The false-positive budget is a gate, verified by RED-proof rather than by observing green.**
`bench/fp_budget.py` re-runs every rule against the clean control for every profile and exits
non-zero on any control *claim*. Raising the zero-ink floor above the control's own measured minimum
makes it exit 1, print 15 false positives and flag the offending rule — so the gate is known to be
able to fail. Current state: **0 control claims across all four profiles, exit 0.** Four classes are
kept apart because the separation is what keeps the number honest: a **claim** on the control spends
the budget; an **abstention** does not (counting it would create a standing incentive to convert
abstentions into confident passes); a tier-2 **question** does not; and a **side effect** — a novel
claim on a defect page off the declared target — is reported but not counted, because novel-vs-control
means the injected CSS caused it and whether that counts against the detector is a per-defect
judgement the corpus does not encode. One side effect exists: the gradient page's `hero-title`, which
genuinely sits on the same varying backdrop as the caption.

**Per-app weightings live in `bench/profiles.py`, and the landing case is what motivates the file.**
`reso-landing-app`'s tokens are the *vendor's*, so `token-drift` and `grid-violation` describe someone
else's system — every finding true, none actionable, and a wall of them is the fastest way to spend
the 20% credibility budget **without a single false positive**. They are suppressed there (0.0) and
promoted to 2.0 under `reso-management-app`, where each is a concrete diff against a system we own.
The same corpus therefore yields 17 determined findings and 13 queued questions under management, and
12 determined and 39 queued under landing. `contrast-indeterminate` is pinned at 1.0 and cannot be
suppressed by any profile: silencing an abstention converts an honest UNVERIFIED into a confident
pass, and an abstention routes to the vision layer where a pass routes nowhere.

**One reproducibility note, which is better news than expected.** This run was captured on Linux under
Liberation Sans rather than macOS under Helvetica, and `findings_dom.json` came back **byte-identical**
to the committed macOS run — the metric-compatible substitute preserves every box-model number the
deterministic layer reads. Only the *ink distribution inside a glyph* differs, which is exactly the
one quantity X2 now declines to judge on the vertical axis.

## 3. Local models: no

Not on quality, not on latency, and not on the analogy.

- **Quality.** The open entrant in *MLLM as a UI Judge* scored **53% on pairwise design preference —
  chance** — against 90–93% for frontier models on clear cases (arXiv 2510.08783). Chance-level design
  advice is actively misleading, not merely worse. Our own measurement above agrees: correct at one
  resolution out of three, confidently wrong at the other two.
- **Latency.** 21–66 s per screenshot, measured here.
- **Quantization.** Spatial and layout reasoning is the *most* quantization-sensitive class measured
  (8–15% loss at 4-bit; the projector is the worst bottleneck; arXiv 2607.08029). A uniform 4-bit
  checkpoint — which is what `mlx-community/*-4bit` gives you by default, and what we measured — is
  precisely the configuration to reject. The correct recipe is 4-bit LLM, ≥8-bit projector, 8-bit or
  fp16 vision tower, and on M1/M2 **fp16 not bf16**, because bf16 is software-emulated on this silicon.
- **The analogy fails on all four properties.** Local speech won because ASR is narrow, has crisp
  ground truth (WER), is high-volume, and is latency-sensitive — and because open 0.6–2.5B models
  literally top the leaderboard. Design critique is open-ended, has no ground truth, is low-volume,
  and tolerates seconds of latency. Nothing transfers.

**Where a local model would earn a place:** bulk anomaly *screening* over a large corpus of
screenshots where the cost of a cloud call per shot is the binding constraint and a 50% hit rate is
acceptable because a second pass adjudicates. We do not have that workload. If we ever do, the config
is `Qwen3.5-35B-A3B` (MoE, ~3B active, roughly 9× cheaper prefill) at ~1344 px, not a dense 27B.

---

## 4. Cloud: default to the vision we already have

The delta over Claude's own vision is narrow and not where intuition puts it. Four free levers come
before any new vendor:

1. **Pin the high-resolution tier and capture at ~2576 px long edge.** Claude 4.7+ ships a
   2576 px / 4,784-visual-token tier automatically; the old 1568 px guidance in our March corpus is
   stale. Opus 4.6 → 4.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro went 69.0% → 79.5% attributed mainly to accepting ~3.3×
   more pixels. **If our pipeline downsamples, we inherit the old score whatever model we buy.**
2. **Take localisation out of the model entirely** — the accessibility tree and `getBoundingClientRect`
   are exact and free.
3. **Crop and zoom rather than downscale.** ScreenSeekeR took OS-Atlas-7B from 18.9% → **48.1%** on
   ScreenSpot-Pro with no model change — a larger delta than every model upgrade combined.
4. **Run the deterministic layer first** so the model is only asked the residue.

Set `transformations: {"oversized_image": "error"}` so a silent resize becomes a 400 naming the exact
target size, rather than quietly destroying the evidence.

**The one genuine gap:** you cannot crop when the question is global — full-page rhythm, whole-frame
sharpness. Claude's high-res tier caps at ~3.75 MP, so a 3840×2160 retina capture loses ~55% of its
pixels. If that case matters, OpenAI's `detail: "original"` is the only documented no-downscale path.
Gemini is worth a call only where there is no accessibility tree at all — canvas, WebGL, PDF comps,
competitor screenshots.

---

## 5. Specialist CV: no, with exactly one exception

Frontier general VLMs have overtaken every open GUI specialist: Claude Opus 4.5 → 4.6 → 4.8 on
ScreenSpot-Pro ran 45.7% → 83.1% → 87.9%, against the best open specialist Holo2-235B at 70.6–78.5%.
Microsoft's own OmniParser successor states it "does **not** rely on separate models to parse the
screen." Scaffold half-life in this field is roughly 18 months. A specialist buys an *inventory*, not
*precision*.

**The exception is saliency, and it is principled rather than accidental.** On the same test set, same
metric, same images (UIGaze, arXiv 2604.26352): UI-trained **UMSI++ scores CC 0.833** against the best
frontier VLM at **CC 0.408** — GPT-5.4 0.408, Claude Opus 4.6 0.344, Gemini 3.1 Pro 0.144. The gap is
2× and the mechanism explains it: early gaze is *pre-semantic*, and a VLM reasons semantically. The
VLM even improves with longer simulated viewing (0.217 at 1 s → 0.408 at 7 s), which is exactly
backwards for the reflexive first second where hierarchy either works or does not.

So saliency is the one place a small specialist model beats everything hosted. Use it as **a second
image plus one decision-relevant statistic** — "the element you named primary captures 4% of predicted
attention mass; the largest mass, 31%, is on the hero image" — never as a score. Blocker: UEyes/UMSI++
weights carry **no license file**; that must be resolved before any non-personal use.

---

## 6. The benchmarks cannot decide this for us

This is the most consequential negative finding in the wave, because it invalidates the obvious way to
pick a model.

- **ScreenSpot-Pro contains zero web screenshots.** It is 1,581 instructions over 23 professional
  *desktop* applications — VSCode, Photoshop, AutoCAD, MATLAB. Every "SOTA on ScreenSpot-Pro" headline
  is evidence about CAD panels. *(This corrects A3, which treated it as the benchmark closest to our
  task; A4 read the benchmark's composition and is right.)*
- **Every ScreenSpot variant scores point-in-box, not IoU.** A prediction counts if a *point* lands
  inside the box. There is no box-quality term, so a model can score 96% with edges tens of pixels
  wrong. **No published number in this field certifies the property a design reviewer needs.**
- **The aggregators are unreliable.** llm-stats' board self-declares "0 verified results, 25
  self-reported". benchlm says Opus 4.6 scores 83.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro; Anthropic's own system card
  says 69.0%. Fourteen points apart. Read vendor system cards, never aggregators.
- **Judgement benchmarks say the judge is the weak link.** WebDevJudge: humans 84.82%, best models
  66.06%. WiserUI-Bench: frontier MLLMs barely above the 50% line, and order-invariant consistent
  accuracy **~30–37%** against a 25% chance baseline. Rubric scoring shows **16–39% top-1 ranking
  reversals from reordering alone**. Even a purpose-built fine-tune reaches 74.25% average but only
  44.30% consistent.
- **The web-specific number to use instead** is WebClick (1,639 real web screenshots): Holo1.5-7B
  90.24, UGround-7B 82.37, stock Qwen2.5-VL-7B 74.37, OmniParser v2 **40.7 at default thresholds**.

Corollary: **the corpus in `bench/` is not a nice-to-have.** It is the only instrument we have that
measures the thing we actually do.

## 7. What the June 2026 decision already settled

A13's audit found the answer to the biggest question was already on disk and had been lost.

The March 2026 corpus describes an architecture whose subject (`/preview/luxury-menu`), instrument
(`scripts/visual-validate.ts`, 1,974 lines) and central bet (autonomous VLM-judge quality gating to
85–90+) were all deleted or refuted by June — and not one of the four documents carries a staleness
banner. `docs/reference-images/` and `~/.claude/hooks/visual-preview.sh` were never built at all. The
`visual-design-iterator` agent *was* built, 568 lines, still on disk, and its first action curls a
route deleted on 2026-04-25 — a live-looking orphan.

Two June measurements outrank everything the March layer asserts:

- The pixel-VRT lane that "automation" actually shipped caught **0 of 6** real bugs prospectively.
  Regression-lock is not prospective detection.
- The campaign ratified: *"Do NOT run the heavy RE-DERIVE path (VLM 'is-it-great' gate / tournament …
  correlate with regression-to-the-mean; taste stays human, gates adjudicate correctness/coverage
  only."*

**That decision stands and this work does not reopen it.** The sanctioned role for the VLM is advisory
triage, never a CI gate. Everything in §2 is a correctness-and-coverage instrument; the taste question
stays with the operator.

The one thing the campaign promised and never produced is the north-star taste yardstick
(`DESIGN_PAGE_METHODOLOGY_PHASE1B_NORTHSTAR.md`, absent, no add-commit in `git log --all`). That gap is
still open.

Also corrected, because our budgets rest on them: the image-token formula is patch-based
`⌈w/28⌉ × ⌈h/28⌉`, not the `/750` in our docs; the API file limit is 10 MB, not 5; Claude models now
return absolute pixel coordinates, so "cannot localize" is stale.

## 8. What to build

Nothing in this list is a model purchase.

**Already built, in `bench/`** — keep and extend:
- `corpus/build_corpus.py` — 13-page ground-truth corpus, `detectable_by` split, clean control.
- `capture.py` — screenshot + full layout/style snapshot in one browser pass, so a pixel finding and a
  DOM finding describe the same frame. sRGB pinned, LCD text off, reduced motion, fonts awaited.
- `detect_dom.py` — nine general design-lint rules with an explicit `INDETERMINATE` verdict.
- `detect_xcheck.py` — the DOM-vs-pixels comparator. All three arms enabled; see §3.1.
- `bench_local_vlm.py` — the resolution/latency sweep.
- `route.py` — the abstention router (§3.1). `--profile <app> [--write-crops]`.
- `fp_budget.py` — the false-positive gate (§3.1). Exits non-zero on a control claim.
- `profiles.py` — per-app rule weightings (§3.1). Run it bare to print the weighting table.

Run order, and it is also the cheapest-first order the architecture argues for:

```
python3 corpus/build_corpus.py corpus/out && python3 capture.py corpus/out
python3 fp_budget.py corpus/out                      # gate: 0 control claims
python3 route.py corpus/out --profile reso-management-app --write-crops
```

**How it reaches a session — a plain CLI, not an MCP server.** A11 checked the assumption and it was
wrong in our favour: an MCP tool *can* return image content to Claude Code. But image data is charged
against `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (default 25,000), and the `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` escape hatch
explicitly "has no effect on tools that return image content" — so an MCP image tool has exactly one
lever, a session-global env var. A CLI that writes a JSON findings file and an annotated PNG, and lets
the agent `Read` the PNG, chooses its own output resolution and therefore stays inside the Read
ladder by construction. Fewer moving parts, and it is already the fleet's habit.

**Division of labour inside the perception layer**, from A5 and confirmed by the bench: **learned
models for semantics and grouping, classical CV for every number.** "Uneven spacing" is a claim about
a distribution of distances — connected components, sort, diff, histogram is the entire computation,
tens of milliseconds of NumPy on one core, and exact rather than probabilistic. A detector emitting
`{"label": "card", "score": 0.91}` has not started on the question. The decisive property is not mean
accuracy but the shape of failure: **classical CV fails by returning an obviously wrong number; a
learned model fails by returning a plausible one.** For a measurement layer feeding an agent that will
act on it, legible failure is worth more than a higher average. (The one place the gap runs the other
way: SAM's masks track rendered edges *better* than natural ones, because a rendered edge is a true
step function — but SAM is not semantic, so it will happily return a pixel-perfect mask of a gradient
band.)

**To add, in order:**
1. ~~**The abstention router.**~~ **BUILT** — `bench/route.py`, §3.1. Deterministic pass first; its
   `INDETERMINATE` set plus the per-app agenda become the VLM's queue, cropped to the region in
   question. The cross-check dequeues the gradient case, and on this corpus that empties tier 1.
2. ~~**A false-positive budget.**~~ **BUILT** — `bench/fp_budget.py`, §3.1, and it is a gate that
   exits non-zero rather than a report. ~20% FP is where an AI reviewer loses credibility regardless
   of catch rate. Our zero-FP runs are the baseline to defend; every rule added is now re-run against
   the clean control on every invocation, per rule and per profile.
3. **Order-randomised comparison.** If we ever compare two designs, permute over 3–5 orderings —
   that recovers about two-thirds of the benefit of ten, and exact balancing buys essentially nothing.
   Report discrimination spread and swap-consistency, never mean agreement.
4. **Motion, deterministically.** `getComputedTiming()` returns duration, easing, delay, iterations
   with `auto` resolved — "this transition is 400 ms and eases wrong" is an assert, not a vision task.
   Note the trap: CDP `Animation.setPlaybackRate(0)` controls WAAPI but not `requestAnimationFrame`,
   while Playwright's `page.clock` patches rAF but not the document timeline. A harness using one has
   a silent hole, and a GSAP page reports "0 animations found" as a false green.
5. **Saliency, second image only**, once the UMSI++ licence question is answered.

**Per-app, because they are three different problems:** `reso-landing-app` (Next 14, purchased
template) is largely a marketing-aesthetics problem; `reso-management-app` (Next 16, React 19,
Tailwind 4) is mostly design-system conformance, where the deterministic layer does nearly all the
work; `reso-web-app` (Next 13) sits between. One review harness, three different rule weightings.
**BUILT** — `bench/profiles.py`, §3.1, with the landing template's vendor-owned tokens suppressed
rather than demoted and the abstention pinned so no profile can silence it.

## 9. What would change this answer

- A local model that clears ~70% on a DiffSpot-shaped eval at under 10 s per screenshot on this Mac.
- A published web-UI defect-localisation benchmark that scores IoU and false positives. None exists.
- A licence for UMSI++, which would move saliency from "promising" to "shippable".
- Evidence that our review bottleneck is *finding* problems rather than *acting* on them. A15's
  sharpest point is that this whole wave assumed perception was the constraint, and the most probable
  failure is a system that sees fine, critiques plausibly, and changes nothing.

## 10. Provenance

15 agent reports in `agents/` (A1–A15; A5 re-fired twice — see below). Bench code and raw results in
`bench/`, including `corpus/out/findings_dom.json`, `local_vlm_results.json` and `corpus/out/blind_key.json`.

**A note on the wave's own failure mode, which is a repo defect worth fixing.** The `deep-research`
agent type grants `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent, ToolSearch, Skill` — and **no
`Write`**. Our mandatory field-7 Delivery contract instructs every agent to write its findings to an
absolute path, so all fifteen had to satisfy it by streaming a 300-line markdown document through a
single Bash heredoc. Ten succeeded. A5 stalled mid-stream doing exactly that, its last words being
*"Write tool is disabled; creating the mandated file via heredoc instead."* The contract and the tool
grant are in conflict. **Fixed in this commit** (`Scope (grown): +repair the deep-research Delivery-
contract conflict`): `Write, Edit` added to `agents/deep-research.md`. That grant widens no
capability — the agent already had `Bash` and could always create files — it only replaces a fragile
channel with the first-class one. A contract an agent cannot satisfy with a proper tool is a contract
that fails under load, and it failed at 2/15.

Both stalled axes were re-fired on `general-purpose` with an explicit write-incrementally instruction
and delivered in full, so coverage is 15/15 with no axis dropped.

**On recovery generally, since it came up:** `/limit-recover`'s *audit principle* is the right
instinct for any cut-off subagent — disk-truth audit every slot, re-run anything not provably
complete, never accept a partial. Its *machinery* is not: it is built for a quota or login cliff and
recovers by transcript transplant to another account. A mid-stream API stall has no reset to wait for
and no account to move to. Audit with it; recover by re-firing.
