# Computer vision for 100th-percentile web design review

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Machine:** Apple M1 Max, 64 GB unified, 32-core GPU
**Question:** what tooling gives our Claude Code sessions genuine visual understanding — spatial
recognition, not image-to-text OCR — so we can run 100th-percentile design review of
`reso-management-app`, `reso-web-app` and `reso-landing-app`? Local models for this Mac, and
cloud/API, on the pattern of Parakeet/Whisper-v3-Turbo locally and the Mistral OCR API in the cloud.

**Method:** 15 parallel research agents (reports in `agents/`) plus a purpose-built ground-truth
defect corpus measured three ways on this machine (`../../../bench/`). Where the agents and the
bench disagree, the bench wins; where agents disagree with each other, both are named.

---

## The answer

**Buy pixels and an eval, not models.** Perception is not our binding constraint, and the analogy to
Parakeet and Mistral OCR does not transfer. Speech recognition and OCR are narrow tasks with crisp
ground truth, high volume, and open models that genuinely match or beat hosted ones. Design critique
has none of those properties. What we are short of is not a better eye — it is (a) the discipline of
never asking a model to compute what the browser already knows, (b) any acceptance test at all, and
(c) a settled decision about what the review is *for*, which we made in June 2026 and then lost.

Three measurements, all taken on this machine today, carry the argument:

| Detector | DOM-determined | Pixels-only | False positives on the clean control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic rules** (~250 lines, 80 ms/page) | **9 / 9** | 0 / 2 (1 honest abstention) | **0** |
| **DOM-vs-pixels cross-check** (~180 lines NumPy, no model) | — | **1 / 2** | **0** |
| **Claude vision, blind** (8 pages, no ground truth) | 2 / 4 | **2 / 2** | **0** |
| **Local `Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`** (MLX, this Mac) | not run | 1 of 3 resolutions correct | invented a defect at 2 of 3 resolutions |

**The union of the first three is 11 of 11**, and each covers precisely what the others cannot. That
complementarity *is* the architecture. The fourth row is why no local model is in it.

📌 **Rows 1 and 2 were re-measured on 2026-09-04 and both moved — see §11.** The cross-check's
gradient arm was silently reporting nothing off macOS (it sampled the text, not the backdrop), and its
centroid arm was inverted. Repaired, the deterministic + cross-check pair now scores **9/9
DOM-determined and 3/3 pixels-scored with 0 findings on the control**, over a corpus grown to 14 pages.
The fourth pixels-only defect, `hierarchy-inversion`, remains reachable by no rule — that is row 3's
territory and the reason the router has a judgement queue at all.

⚠️ **This table is a correction.** The first version scored three pixels-only defects and reported
6 of 7. Building the cross-check exposed the reason: the `optical-centering` variant injected an
*empty* CSS rule, so its render was **SHA-256 identical to the control**. It was a null test item, and
both the deterministic layer and the blind reviewer were *right* to report nothing on it — I had
scored a correct abstention as a miss, against both. The corpus now injects a real delta (the base
carries optical compensation; the variant removes it), and the honest population is 9 DOM-determined
plus 2 pixels-only. **A corpus needs its own control run before it is allowed to grade anything**, and
mine did not get one until a third detector disagreed with it.

---

## 1. What we measured, and why it settles more than the literature does

The corpus (`bench/corpus/build_corpus.py`) renders one realistic dashboard thirteen ways: a clean
control plus twelve variants, each carrying exactly one injected defect at a known location with a
known magnitude. Nine defects are fully determined by the DOM. Three are invisible to it *by
construction* — the computed styles are correct and the rendering is still wrong.
*(Fourteen ways since 2026-09-04: §11 adds `contrast-on-pattern`, the case neither the DOM nor the
cross-check can settle, so that the abstention router has a genuine abstention to route.)*

That split is the whole instrument. It is the same shape as **DiffSpot** (arXiv 2605.29615, May
2026), which mutates one CSS property, re-renders, and asks what changed — and on which the best of
thirteen models scores **47.2%**, with hard-tier recall below 23% for every model and `line-height`
median recall at **4.0%**. We reproduced that difficulty independently.

**Three findings the corpus produced that no report predicted:**

**The "clean" control was not clean.** The first run flagged four defects on the hand-authored
baseline. Three were real WCAG failures I had written myself without noticing — white on blue-600 is
3.68:1, blue-100 on blue-600 is 3.01:1, both under the 4.5:1 floor. A deterministic linter earned its
keep before it ever saw an injected defect. (Fixed by moving to blue-700: 6.70:1 and 5.49:1.)

**Deduplicating findings by `(rule, target)` silently swallowed a real defect.** The colour-token
drift on the primary button was suppressed because an unrelated `token-drift` finding already existed
on that same element in the baseline. The key has to span the claim, not just its location — the
`assertion-span-must-equal-its-subject` failure, reproduced live. It scored 0/1 until fixed, then 1/1.

**Claude's blind review found three real defects nobody injected and no rule was looking for:** a
table caption promising grey rows that do not exist, an unlabelled icon button with the smallest hit
target on the page, and numeric columns left-aligned so the digits do not line up. None is reachable
by any rule I wrote, because none is a *violation* — each is a judgement about whether the page makes
sense. **That is the capability that cannot be replaced, and it is the one the deterministic layer
cannot grow into.**

### The local model, measured

No M1 Max VLM benchmark exists in public — A2 searched and found every fast Apple-Silicon number is
M4 Pro/Max or M5. So here is one, on the hierarchy-inversion page, `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`
(released 2026-08-14), 16.1 GB resident, cold vision encode every row because a review loop never
shows the same screenshot twice:

| Input width | Megapixels | Image tokens | Wall clock | Prefill | Decode | Peak GPU | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2560 px | 4.61 | ~1456 | **65.8 s** | 78.4 t/s | 16.7 t/s | 19.6 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |
| **1344 px** | **1.27** | ~396 | **30.2 s** | 78.6 t/s | 12.3 t/s | 19.0 GB | **correct** |
| 1024 px | 0.74 | ~225 | **21.1 s** | 66.2 t/s | 12.6 t/s | 18.1 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |

Two things fall out. **Accuracy is non-monotonic in resolution with a sweet spot near 1 MP**, which
independently reproduces mlx-vlm#1175 (mean IoU 0.542 at 12.8 MP → 0.736 at 1 MP) on different
hardware and a different task. And **the failure mode is a confident false positive** — at two of
three resolutions it named a misalignment that is not in the page. A detector that invents defects is
worse than no detector, because an agent *acts* on them.

21–66 s per screenshot also settles the interactivity question: this is a batch tool, not a loop
participant.

---

## 2. The architecture: three substrates, and never mix up which answers what

| Substrate | Answers | Never ask it |
|---|---|---|
| **Computed styles / CDP box model** | every question with a number in the answer — spacing, alignment, contrast against a solid backdrop, overflow, target size, token conformance, animation duration and easing | whether it looks good |
| **Accessibility tree** | semantic conformance, element identity, attribution back to source | anything perceptual — a perfectly valid a11y tree coexists with text overlap and occlusion |
| **Pixels (a frontier VLM)** | hierarchy, attention, "does this page make sense", contrast over a gradient, anything where the styles are right and the render is wrong | any number |

The governing rule, from A4 and confirmed by the bench: **the grounder supplies identity, the DOM
supplies geometry.** A model-produced bounding box is a 68-mAP estimate of something
`getBoundingClientRect()` returns exactly, for free, with no hallucination risk. Forbid the judge from
computing any distance from a box a model drew.

An agent using one substrate has a *silent* blind spot — it emits a confident clean report. That is
the most dangerous failure mode available to us and it is why the split is the architecture rather
than an optimisation.

### The seam, made explicit

The deterministic layer's most valuable output is not a finding, it is an **abstention**. On the
gradient-backdrop page it returns `contrast-indeterminate: cannot compute a ratio, backdrop is an
image/gradient — requirement 4.5:1 is UNVERIFIED for this text`, rather than a pass. Every silent
pass that should have been an abstention is a defect shipped. The abstention set is exactly the
vision layer's job queue, and it is small, which is what makes the vision spend affordable.

**Use `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot`, and do not let it delete that abstention.** A7 found the call
returns the compositor's own *blended* background colour per text run — the correct contrast operand,
which every JS ancestor-walk (including this bench's first version) merely approximates. Measured here:
**7.8 ms**, populated for 31 of 83 layout nodes, and it correctly resolves alpha and layered backdrops.
It is also 29× faster than the in-page `getComputedStyle` loop most tooling uses and 177× faster than
the per-node CDP walk, and the entire fact-pack serialises to ~854 tokens — *less than a screenshot*.
There is no context-budget argument for withholding facts from the judge.

But it samples **one** colour per text run, and on our gradient page it returned `rgb(30, 58, 138)` —
the gradient's leftmost stop:

| Sample point | Contrast vs white | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| left stop `#1E3A8A` — **what CDP reported** | **10.36:1** | PASS |
| mid `#3B82F6` | 3.68:1 | FAIL |
| right `#DBEAFE` — where the text actually sits | **1.22:1** | FAIL |

A nine-point swing across a single text run, and the scalar reports the passing end. **Adopting the
blended colour naively converts an honest `INDETERMINATE` into a confident false PASS, which is
strictly worse** — an abstention routes to the vision layer, a pass routes nowhere. This is the
fail-safe-default-mimics-the-healthy-state trap, and it would have been invisible: the rule gets
*better* on solid and layered backdrops at the same moment it goes blind on varying ones.

The rule that survives both findings: **take the blended colour, and keep the abstention whenever the
resolved backdrop chain contains a gradient or an image**, because no scalar can represent a backdrop
that varies across the element it sits on.

### The third layer: measure the DISAGREEMENT, not either side

A5's sharpest claim is that the high-value defects live in the *gap* between the two descriptions
rather than in either one, and that the cross-check is therefore the thing to build first — about 200
lines of NumPy, no model, no GPU. Built it (`bench/detect_xcheck.py`) and it holds. It is not a third
detector; it is a comparator that fires only where the DOM's claim and the rendered pixels disagree by
more than a stated tolerance, which means it needs no aesthetic judgement and no learned model.

The validated arm settles the gradient case that the scalar could not:

```
contrast-on-gradient
  [xcheck-contrast-varies] contrast is not one number across this text: 4.81:1 at
  the left edge and 1.57:1 at the right. Any single computed value is a fiction,
  and the right end is the one that fails a reader.
```

Sampling the backdrop separately in the left and right thirds turns "unrepresentable" into two
numbers and a verdict — no VLM call, no abstention, zero findings on the control. **That moves
contrast-over-a-gradient out of the vision layer's queue entirely.**

🚨 **The centroid arm shipped PROVISIONAL and disabled** (`--x2` to enable), because trying to
validate it found two defects in it, and both are instances of the exact failure this document warns
about — a plausible number nobody checked. (a) It compares ink to the element's **own** box, and
`getBoundingClientRect` returns the *post*-transform box, so a `translate` moves box and ink together
and the measured offset is **invariant under the very compensation it is supposed to verify**. (b) Its
background is the crop's modal colour, so on a round button the square crop's corners — page
background outside the circle — count as ink and swamp a 16px glyph. Both fixes are known (measure
against the container; mask to the painted shape) and neither is done. Shipping it on would have
handed the pipeline a confident number with no ground truth behind it.

**✅ Both fixed, and the arm is now ON by default (`--no-x2` to disable) — 2026-09-04. See §11.** The
inversion was worse than "unvalidated": measured before the fix, X2 reported **2 findings on the clean
control and 0 on the optical-centering variant**, i.e. it was exactly backwards, and the `--x2` flag was
the only thing standing between that and a pipeline acting on it. It now measures against the
container's painted shape — reconstructed analytically from the rect and border-radius the DOM already
reports exactly, and eroded past the antialiased rim — and scores 0 on the control, 1 on the defect,
naming the mark.

## 3. Local models: no

Not on quality, not on latency, and not on the analogy.

- **Quality.** The open entrant in *MLLM as a UI Judge* scored **53% on pairwise design preference —
  chance** — against 90–93% for frontier models on clear cases (arXiv 2510.08783). Chance-level design
  advice is actively misleading, not merely worse. Our own measurement above agrees: correct at one
  resolution out of three, confidently wrong at the other two.
- **Latency.** 21–66 s per screenshot, measured here.
- **Quantization.** Spatial and layout reasoning is the *most* quantization-sensitive class measured
  (8–15% loss at 4-bit; the projector is the worst bottleneck; arXiv 2607.08029). A uniform 4-bit
  checkpoint — which is what `mlx-community/*-4bit` gives you by default, and what we measured — is
  precisely the configuration to reject. The correct recipe is 4-bit LLM, ≥8-bit projector, 8-bit or
  fp16 vision tower, and on M1/M2 **fp16 not bf16**, because bf16 is software-emulated on this silicon.
- **The analogy fails on all four properties.** Local speech won because ASR is narrow, has crisp
  ground truth (WER), is high-volume, and is latency-sensitive — and because open 0.6–2.5B models
  literally top the leaderboard. Design critique is open-ended, has no ground truth, is low-volume,
  and tolerates seconds of latency. Nothing transfers.

**Where a local model would earn a place:** bulk anomaly *screening* over a large corpus of
screenshots where the cost of a cloud call per shot is the binding constraint and a 50% hit rate is
acceptable because a second pass adjudicates. We do not have that workload. If we ever do, the config
is `Qwen3.5-35B-A3B` (MoE, ~3B active, roughly 9× cheaper prefill) at ~1344 px, not a dense 27B.

---

## 4. Cloud: default to the vision we already have

The delta over Claude's own vision is narrow and not where intuition puts it. Four free levers come
before any new vendor:

1. **Pin the high-resolution tier and capture at ~2576 px long edge.** Claude 4.7+ ships a
   2576 px / 4,784-visual-token tier automatically; the old 1568 px guidance in our March corpus is
   stale. Opus 4.6 → 4.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro went 69.0% → 79.5% attributed mainly to accepting ~3.3×
   more pixels. **If our pipeline downsamples, we inherit the old score whatever model we buy.**
2. **Take localisation out of the model entirely** — the accessibility tree and `getBoundingClientRect`
   are exact and free.
3. **Crop and zoom rather than downscale.** ScreenSeekeR took OS-Atlas-7B from 18.9% → **48.1%** on
   ScreenSpot-Pro with no model change — a larger delta than every model upgrade combined.
4. **Run the deterministic layer first** so the model is only asked the residue.

Set `transformations: {"oversized_image": "error"}` so a silent resize becomes a 400 naming the exact
target size, rather than quietly destroying the evidence.

**The one genuine gap:** you cannot crop when the question is global — full-page rhythm, whole-frame
sharpness. Claude's high-res tier caps at ~3.75 MP, so a 3840×2160 retina capture loses ~55% of its
pixels. If that case matters, OpenAI's `detail: "original"` is the only documented no-downscale path.
Gemini is worth a call only where there is no accessibility tree at all — canvas, WebGL, PDF comps,
competitor screenshots.

---

## 5. Specialist CV: no, with exactly one exception

Frontier general VLMs have overtaken every open GUI specialist: Claude Opus 4.5 → 4.6 → 4.8 on
ScreenSpot-Pro ran 45.7% → 83.1% → 87.9%, against the best open specialist Holo2-235B at 70.6–78.5%.
Microsoft's own OmniParser successor states it "does **not** rely on separate models to parse the
screen." Scaffold half-life in this field is roughly 18 months. A specialist buys an *inventory*, not
*precision*.

**The exception is saliency, and it is principled rather than accidental.** On the same test set, same
metric, same images (UIGaze, arXiv 2604.26352): UI-trained **UMSI++ scores CC 0.833** against the best
frontier VLM at **CC 0.408** — GPT-5.4 0.408, Claude Opus 4.6 0.344, Gemini 3.1 Pro 0.144. The gap is
2× and the mechanism explains it: early gaze is *pre-semantic*, and a VLM reasons semantically. The
VLM even improves with longer simulated viewing (0.217 at 1 s → 0.408 at 7 s), which is exactly
backwards for the reflexive first second where hierarchy either works or does not.

So saliency is the one place a small specialist model beats everything hosted. Use it as **a second
image plus one decision-relevant statistic** — "the element you named primary captures 4% of predicted
attention mass; the largest mass, 31%, is on the hero image" — never as a score. Blocker: UEyes/UMSI++
weights carry **no license file**; that must be resolved before any non-personal use.

---

## 6. The benchmarks cannot decide this for us

This is the most consequential negative finding in the wave, because it invalidates the obvious way to
pick a model.

- **ScreenSpot-Pro contains zero web screenshots.** It is 1,581 instructions over 23 professional
  *desktop* applications — VSCode, Photoshop, AutoCAD, MATLAB. Every "SOTA on ScreenSpot-Pro" headline
  is evidence about CAD panels. *(This corrects A3, which treated it as the benchmark closest to our
  task; A4 read the benchmark's composition and is right.)*
- **Every ScreenSpot variant scores point-in-box, not IoU.** A prediction counts if a *point* lands
  inside the box. There is no box-quality term, so a model can score 96% with edges tens of pixels
  wrong. **No published number in this field certifies the property a design reviewer needs.**
- **The aggregators are unreliable.** llm-stats' board self-declares "0 verified results, 25
  self-reported". benchlm says Opus 4.6 scores 83.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro; Anthropic's own system card
  says 69.0%. Fourteen points apart. Read vendor system cards, never aggregators.
- **Judgement benchmarks say the judge is the weak link.** WebDevJudge: humans 84.82%, best models
  66.06%. WiserUI-Bench: frontier MLLMs barely above the 50% line, and order-invariant consistent
  accuracy **~30–37%** against a 25% chance baseline. Rubric scoring shows **16–39% top-1 ranking
  reversals from reordering alone**. Even a purpose-built fine-tune reaches 74.25% average but only
  44.30% consistent.
- **The web-specific number to use instead** is WebClick (1,639 real web screenshots): Holo1.5-7B
  90.24, UGround-7B 82.37, stock Qwen2.5-VL-7B 74.37, OmniParser v2 **40.7 at default thresholds**.

Corollary: **the corpus in `bench/` is not a nice-to-have.** It is the only instrument we have that
measures the thing we actually do.

---

## 7. What the June 2026 decision already settled

A13's audit found the answer to the biggest question was already on disk and had been lost.

The March 2026 corpus describes an architecture whose subject (`/preview/luxury-menu`), instrument
(`scripts/visual-validate.ts`, 1,974 lines) and central bet (autonomous VLM-judge quality gating to
85–90+) were all deleted or refuted by June — and not one of the four documents carries a staleness
banner. `docs/reference-images/` and `~/.claude/hooks/visual-preview.sh` were never built at all. The
`visual-design-iterator` agent *was* built, 568 lines, still on disk, and its first action curls a
route deleted on 2026-04-25 — a live-looking orphan.

Two June measurements outrank everything the March layer asserts:

- The pixel-VRT lane that "automation" actually shipped caught **0 of 6** real bugs prospectively.
  Regression-lock is not prospective detection.
- The campaign ratified: *"Do NOT run the heavy RE-DERIVE path (VLM 'is-it-great' gate / tournament …
  correlate with regression-to-the-mean; taste stays human, gates adjudicate correctness/coverage
  only."*

**That decision stands and this work does not reopen it.** The sanctioned role for the VLM is advisory
triage, never a CI gate. Everything in §2 is a correctness-and-coverage instrument; the taste question
stays with the operator.

The one thing the campaign promised and never produced is the north-star taste yardstick
(`DESIGN_PAGE_METHODOLOGY_PHASE1B_NORTHSTAR.md`, absent, no add-commit in `git log --all`). That gap is
still open.

Also corrected, because our budgets rest on them: the image-token formula is patch-based
`⌈w/28⌉ × ⌈h/28⌉`, not the `/750` in our docs; the API file limit is 10 MB, not 5; Claude models now
return absolute pixel coordinates, so "cannot localize" is stale.

---

## 8. What to build

Nothing in this list is a model purchase.

**Already built, in `bench/`** — keep and extend:
- `corpus/build_corpus.py` — 13-page ground-truth corpus, `detectable_by` split, clean control.
- `capture.py` — screenshot + full layout/style snapshot in one browser pass, so a pixel finding and a
  DOM finding describe the same frame. sRGB pinned, LCD text off, reduced motion, fonts awaited.
- `detect_dom.py` — nine general design-lint rules with an explicit `INDETERMINATE` verdict.
- `bench_local_vlm.py` — the resolution/latency sweep.

**How it reaches a session — a plain CLI, not an MCP server.** A11 checked the assumption and it was
wrong in our favour: an MCP tool *can* return image content to Claude Code. But image data is charged
against `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (default 25,000), and the `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` escape hatch
explicitly "has no effect on tools that return image content" — so an MCP image tool has exactly one
lever, a session-global env var. A CLI that writes a JSON findings file and an annotated PNG, and lets
the agent `Read` the PNG, chooses its own output resolution and therefore stays inside the Read
ladder by construction. Fewer moving parts, and it is already the fleet's habit.

**Division of labour inside the perception layer**, from A5 and confirmed by the bench: **learned
models for semantics and grouping, classical CV for every number.** "Uneven spacing" is a claim about
a distribution of distances — connected components, sort, diff, histogram is the entire computation,
tens of milliseconds of NumPy on one core, and exact rather than probabilistic. A detector emitting
`{"label": "card", "score": 0.91}` has not started on the question. The decisive property is not mean
accuracy but the shape of failure: **classical CV fails by returning an obviously wrong number; a
learned model fails by returning a plausible one.** For a measurement layer feeding an agent that will
act on it, legible failure is worth more than a higher average. (The one place the gap runs the other
way: SAM's masks track rendered edges *better* than natural ones, because a rendered edge is a true
step function — but SAM is not semantic, so it will happily return a pixel-perfect mask of a gradient
band.)

**To add, in order:**
1. ✅ **The abstention router.** — **built 2026-09-04, `bench/route.py`; see §11.** (The cross-check in `bench/detect_xcheck.py` already removes the gradient case from this queue.) Deterministic pass first; its `INDETERMINATE` set plus the pages it
   cannot reason about become the VLM's queue, cropped to the region in question.
2. ✅ **A false-positive budget.** — **built 2026-09-04, `bench/fp_budget.py`; see §11.** ~20% FP is where an AI reviewer loses credibility regardless of catch
   rate. Our two zero-FP runs are the baseline to defend; every rule added must be re-run against the
   clean control before it ships.
3. **Order-randomised comparison.** If we ever compare two designs, permute over 3–5 orderings —
   that recovers about two-thirds of the benefit of ten, and exact balancing buys essentially nothing.
   Report discrimination spread and swap-consistency, never mean agreement.
4. **Motion, deterministically.** `getComputedTiming()` returns duration, easing, delay, iterations
   with `auto` resolved — "this transition is 400 ms and eases wrong" is an assert, not a vision task.
   Note the trap: CDP `Animation.setPlaybackRate(0)` controls WAAPI but not `requestAnimationFrame`,
   while Playwright's `page.clock` patches rAF but not the document timeline. A harness using one has
   a silent hole, and a GSAP page reports "0 animations found" as a false green.
5. **Saliency, second image only**, once the UMSI++ licence question is answered.

**Per-app, because they are three different problems:** `reso-landing-app` (Next 14, purchased
template) is largely a marketing-aesthetics problem; `reso-management-app` (Next 16, React 19,
Tailwind 4) is mostly design-system conformance, where the deterministic layer does nearly all the
work; `reso-web-app` (Next 13) sits between. One review harness, three different rule weightings.
✅ **Built 2026-09-04, `bench/profiles.py`; see §11.**

## 9. What would change this answer

- A local model that clears ~70% on a DiffSpot-shaped eval at under 10 s per screenshot on this Mac.
- A published web-UI defect-localisation benchmark that scores IoU and false positives. None exists.
- A licence for UMSI++, which would move saliency from "promising" to "shippable".
- Evidence that our review bottleneck is *finding* problems rather than *acting* on them. A15's
  sharpest point is that this whole wave assumed perception was the constraint, and the most probable
  failure is a system that sees fine, critiques plausibly, and changes nothing.

## 10. Provenance

15 agent reports in `agents/` (A1–A15; A5 re-fired twice — see below). Bench code and raw results in
`bench/`, including `corpus/out/findings_dom.json`, `local_vlm_results.json` and `corpus/out/blind_key.json`.

**A note on the wave's own failure mode, which is a repo defect worth fixing.** The `deep-research`
agent type grants `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent, ToolSearch, Skill` — and **no
`Write`**. Our mandatory field-7 Delivery contract instructs every agent to write its findings to an
absolute path, so all fifteen had to satisfy it by streaming a 300-line markdown document through a
single Bash heredoc. Ten succeeded. A5 stalled mid-stream doing exactly that, its last words being
*"Write tool is disabled; creating the mandated file via heredoc instead."* The contract and the tool
grant are in conflict. **Fixed in this commit** (`Scope (grown): +repair the deep-research Delivery-
contract conflict`): `Write, Edit` added to `agents/deep-research.md`. That grant widens no
capability — the agent already had `Bash` and could always create files — it only replaces a fragile
channel with the first-class one. A contract an agent cannot satisfy with a proper tool is a contract
that fails under load, and it failed at 2/15.

Both stalled axes were re-fired on `general-purpose` with an explicit write-incrementally instruction
and delivered in full, so coverage is 15/15 with no axis dropped.

**On recovery generally, since it came up:** `/limit-recover`'s *audit principle* is the right
instinct for any cut-off subagent — disk-truth audit every slot, re-run anything not provably
complete, never accept a partial. Its *machinery* is not: it is built for a quota or login cliff and
recovers by transcript transplant to another account. A mid-stream API stall has no reset to wait for
and no account to move to. Audit with it; recover by re-firing.

## 11. Built — the perception pipeline (2026-09-04)

§8's first two items, the X2 fix from §2, and the per-app weightings from §8 are on disk and
measured. Four things were added or repaired; six things measuring them found are recorded below,
because five of the six are the same failure this document is about — **a plausible number nobody
checked** — and one of them was in the arm this document already flagged, pointing the wrong way.

**⚠️ Every number in this section was measured on Linux/Chromium 1194 in a container, not on the
M1 Max.** That difference is not incidental: it is what exposed finding 4.

```bash
cd bench && python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install numpy pillow playwright
.venv/bin/python corpus/build_corpus.py corpus/out     # 14 pages
.venv/bin/python capture.py corpus/out                 # shots + snapshots, one pass
.venv/bin/python fp_budget.py corpus/out               # the gate; exits non-zero on a breach
.venv/bin/python route.py corpus/out --profile reso-management
```

### What it does now

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `bench/route.py` | **The abstention router.** Deterministic pass first; abstentions the cross-check can answer are *discharged* and never queued; what is left is cropped, enlarged and queued with the question and the DOM's own numbers. Calls no model. |
| `bench/fp_budget.py` | **The false-positive gate.** Control findings (budget 0), off-target findings (budget 20%), and recall beside them so a silent detector cannot score well by finding nothing. Exits non-zero. |
| `bench/profiles.py` | **Per-app rule weightings.** `reso-management` conformance-led, `reso-landing` marketing-led with the conformance rules off, `reso-web` between, `bench` unweighted so a weighting can never flatter the instrument. |
| `bench/detect_xcheck.py` | X2 fixed and **on by default**; X3's backdrop sampling repaired twice (findings 2 and 3). |

The run, under the unweighted `bench` profile:

```
CONTROL  clean.html -> 0 finding(s), budget 0
OFF-TARGET  0/23 = 0.0%, budget 20%
RECALL      dom    9/9
RECALL      pixels 3/3
RESIDUE     1 defect in a class no rule reaches -- the router's judgement queue, not a miss
14 pages -> 17 decided deterministically · 2 abstentions discharged by the cross-check
          · 2 left abstaining · 2 queued        [reso-management]
```

**Two queue entries across fourteen pages is the affordability claim, made concrete.** Everything
else was either decided for free or answered by the cross-check.

### Six things measuring found

**1. X2 was not unvalidated, it was INVERTED.** Before the fix it reported **2 findings on the clean
control and 0 on the optical-centering variant** — it fired where the compensation was present and
stayed quiet where it had been removed. §2 called it "a real quantity nobody has validated"; the
quantity was pointing backwards, and only the `--x2` default-off flag stood between that and a
pipeline acting on it. Both known fixes were the cure: measure against the **container's** painted
shape (upstream of the mark's own transform, so it can witness what the post-transform box cannot),
and **mask** to that shape — rebuilt analytically from the rect and border-radius the DOM already
reports exactly, eroded 1.5px past the antialiased rim. After: **0 on the control, 1 on the defect**,
2.0px left against an injected 2.33px.

**2. The modal colour is not a backdrop sample, and over a gradient it samples the TEXT.** X3 took
the most common colour in each third as the backdrop. Over a smooth gradient no backdrop colour
repeats — every column is its own colour — so the most common colour in the band was the antialiased
white text, and the check compared white against white for **1.00:1**, reporting nothing. The
gradient defect, the one arm §2 presents as validated, was silently unreported off macOS. Fixed by
excluding pixels near the computed foreground and taking the **median** of the survivors. The
endpoints now read 7.79:1 → 1.48:1, against §2's stated ~8.6:1 → ~1.2:1.

**3. Two samples cannot tell a ramp from a stripe.** A repeating-stripe backdrop produces a swing as
large as a gradient's, and X3 reported it as `contrast is 1.51:1 at the left edge and 10.36:1 at the
right` — a monotonic left-to-right story that is simply false; the value alternates every 14px and
neither endpoint describes what a reader meets. Fixed by sampling **six** bands and licensing the
two-number summary only when the sequence is monotone *and* no band is internally bimodal
(interquartile luminance ≤ 0.15; the gradient's bands measure ~0.06, the stripes' ~0.67). A patterned
backdrop now emits `xcheck-backdrop-indeterminate`, an **abstention carrying its evidence** — which
is what the router is for, and what puts the first real cropped entry in its queue.

**4. The clean control was not clean off macOS, and the corpus said it would be.** `build_corpus.py`
pinned `Helvetica` "so a render is reproducible across machines" — but Helvetica exists on macOS and
nowhere else, and the corpus's optical compensation was a constant (`translate(2px, 2px)`) measured
against *its* metrics. Under the DejaVu fallback the U+25B6 glyph sits ~1.7px **below** its line
box's centre where Helvetica's sits above it, so the compensation cancelled the bias on one machine
and **doubled** it on another: 3.7px of real ink offset on the "clean" page. The mark is now **drawn
with borders instead of set in a font** — base left, apex right, so its ink centroid is 14/6 = 2.33px
left of the box centre by arithmetic rather than by measurement, on every renderer. *A corpus whose
ground truth is a font metric has ground truth only where that font is.*

**5. A type-scale rung was resting on a decorative element.** Removing the glyph's text removed its
`font-size: 16px`, which was the *second* use of 16px on the page — and `type-scale` fires on any
size used once. The scale rule went off on the clean control. The base page now carries 16px on the
button labels as well as the section heading, so the rung is held by two real components. *A scale
step propped up by one element that paints no text is not a step.*

**6. Scoring recall without the defect CLASS inflates it.** `hierarchy-inversion` scored a hit
because two unrelated rules fire inside `.actions` — the injected CSS also drifts a colour token —
and the recall column read 4/4 for a stack that cannot reach visual hierarchy at all. `fp_budget.py`
now requires the finding's class to match the defect's, and reports a class no rule reaches as
**RESIDUE** rather than as a miss. That single residue item is the judgement queue's entire
justification, and it now appears as such in the run.

### What the weightings cost, stated

`reso-landing` turns `token-drift` and `grid-violation` **off**, not down, because on a purchased
template they measure our convention against somebody else's deliberate design. The gate reports the
bill: **dom recall 6/9 under that profile**, giving up `radius-drift`, `token-color-drift` and
`grid-offgrid` by choice. `reso-management` keeps every rule, weights conformance highest, and turns
the whole-page judgement queue **off** — an internal admin surface does not buy per-screen taste —
which is why it queues 2 entries where `reso-landing` queues 16.

### Still not built, and unchanged by this

Order-randomised comparison (§8.3), motion via `getComputedTiming()` (§8.4), and saliency (§8.5,
still blocked on the UMSI++ licence). The north-star taste yardstick from §7 is still absent.

🚨 **No model is called anywhere in this pipeline, and no local VLM was added.** `route.py` prepares
a queue and stops. The June 2026 decision — taste stays human, gates adjudicate correctness and
coverage only — is unchanged and unreopened; `fp_budget.py` is a gate on the *detector's*
correctness, which is the sanctioned kind.
