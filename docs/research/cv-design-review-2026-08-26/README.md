# Computer vision for 100th-percentile web design review

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Machine:** Apple M1 Max, 64 GB unified, 32-core GPU
**Question:** what tooling gives our Claude Code sessions genuine visual understanding — spatial
recognition, not image-to-text OCR — so we can run 100th-percentile design review of
`reso-management-app`, `reso-web-app` and `reso-landing-app`? Local models for this Mac, and
cloud/API, on the pattern of Parakeet/Whisper-v3-Turbo locally and the Mistral OCR API in the cloud.

**Method:** 15 parallel research agents (reports in `agents/`) plus a purpose-built ground-truth
defect corpus measured three ways on this machine (`../../../bench/`). Where the agents and the
bench disagree, the bench wins; where agents disagree with each other, both are named.

---

## The answer

**Buy pixels and an eval, not models.** Perception is not our binding constraint, and the analogy to
Parakeet and Mistral OCR does not transfer. Speech recognition and OCR are narrow tasks with crisp
ground truth, high volume, and open models that genuinely match or beat hosted ones. Design critique
has none of those properties. What we are short of is not a better eye — it is (a) the discipline of
never asking a model to compute what the browser already knows, (b) any acceptance test at all, and
(c) a settled decision about what the review is *for*, which we made in June 2026 and then lost.

Three measurements, all taken on this machine today, carry the argument:

| Detector | DOM-determined | Pixels-only | False positives on the clean control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic rules** (~250 lines, 80 ms/page) | **9 / 9** | 0 / 4 (1 honest abstention) | **0** |
| **DOM-vs-pixels cross-check** (~400 lines NumPy, no model) | — | **4 / 4** | **0** |
| **Claude vision, blind** (8 pages, no ground truth) | 2 / 4 | **2 / 2** | **0** |
| **Local `Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`** (MLX, this Mac) | not run | 1 of 3 resolutions correct | invented a defect at 2 of 3 resolutions |

**The union of the first three is 13 of 13** — the fourteenth, `hierarchy-inversion`, is reachable
only by the judgement lane and is routed there rather than scored here. Each layer covers precisely
what the others cannot; that complementarity *is* the architecture. The fourth row is why no local
model is in it.

⚠️ **Rows 1 and 2 are from the 2026-09-03 build; rows 3 and 4 are the 2026-08-26 measurements and have
not been re-run against the two variants added since.** The cross-check moved from 1/2 to 4/4 by
fixing its centroid arm (§2.1), fixing a silent failure in its gradient arm (§2.2), and gaining two
corpus variants that the false-positive gate refused to run without (§8).

⚠️ **This table is a correction.** The first version scored three pixels-only defects and reported
6 of 7. Building the cross-check exposed the reason: the `optical-centering` variant injected an
*empty* CSS rule, so its render was **SHA-256 identical to the control**. It was a null test item, and
both the deterministic layer and the blind reviewer were *right* to report nothing on it — I had
scored a correct abstention as a miss, against both. The corpus now injects a real delta (the base
carries optical compensation; the variant removes it), and the honest population is 9 DOM-determined
plus 2 pixels-only. **A corpus needs its own control run before it is allowed to grade anything**, and
mine did not get one until a third detector disagreed with it.

---

## 1. What we measured, and why it settles more than the literature does

The corpus (`bench/corpus/build_corpus.py`, v1.1) renders one realistic dashboard fifteen ways: a
clean control plus fourteen variants, each carrying exactly one injected defect at a known location
with a known magnitude. Nine defects are fully determined by the DOM. Five are invisible to it *by
construction* — the computed styles are correct and the rendering is still wrong — and **one of those
five has `expect: abstain`**, meaning a correct detector returns `INDETERMINATE` on it and asserting
would be the error. Until that field existed nothing graded the abstention, which the rest of this
document calls the most valuable output the deterministic layer has: an arm that abstained correctly
and an arm that missed the defect entirely scored identically.

That split is the whole instrument. It is the same shape as **DiffSpot** (arXiv 2605.29615, May
2026), which mutates one CSS property, re-renders, and asks what changed — and on which the best of
thirteen models scores **47.2%**, with hard-tier recall below 23% for every model and `line-height`
median recall at **4.0%**. We reproduced that difficulty independently.

**Three findings the corpus produced that no report predicted:**

**The "clean" control was not clean.** The first run flagged four defects on the hand-authored
baseline. Three were real WCAG failures I had written myself without noticing — white on blue-600 is
3.68:1, blue-100 on blue-600 is 3.01:1, both under the 4.5:1 floor. A deterministic linter earned its
keep before it ever saw an injected defect. (Fixed by moving to blue-700: 6.70:1 and 5.49:1.)

**Deduplicating findings by `(rule, target)` silently swallowed a real defect.** The colour-token
drift on the primary button was suppressed because an unrelated `token-drift` finding already existed
on that same element in the baseline. The key has to span the claim, not just its location — the
`assertion-span-must-equal-its-subject` failure, reproduced live. It scored 0/1 until fixed, then 1/1.

**Claude's blind review found three real defects nobody injected and no rule was looking for:** a
table caption promising grey rows that do not exist, an unlabelled icon button with the smallest hit
target on the page, and numeric columns left-aligned so the digits do not line up. None is reachable
by any rule I wrote, because none is a *violation* — each is a judgement about whether the page makes
sense. **That is the capability that cannot be replaced, and it is the one the deterministic layer
cannot grow into.**

### The local model, measured

No M1 Max VLM benchmark exists in public — A2 searched and found every fast Apple-Silicon number is
M4 Pro/Max or M5. So here is one, on the hierarchy-inversion page, `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`
(released 2026-08-14), 16.1 GB resident, cold vision encode every row because a review loop never
shows the same screenshot twice:

| Input width | Megapixels | Image tokens | Wall clock | Prefill | Decode | Peak GPU | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2560 px | 4.61 | ~1456 | **65.8 s** | 78.4 t/s | 16.7 t/s | 19.6 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |
| **1344 px** | **1.27** | ~396 | **30.2 s** | 78.6 t/s | 12.3 t/s | 19.0 GB | **correct** |
| 1024 px | 0.74 | ~225 | **21.1 s** | 66.2 t/s | 12.6 t/s | 18.1 GB | wrong — invented a misalignment |

Two things fall out. **Accuracy is non-monotonic in resolution with a sweet spot near 1 MP**, which
independently reproduces mlx-vlm#1175 (mean IoU 0.542 at 12.8 MP → 0.736 at 1 MP) on different
hardware and a different task. And **the failure mode is a confident false positive** — at two of
three resolutions it named a misalignment that is not in the page. A detector that invents defects is
worse than no detector, because an agent *acts* on them.

21–66 s per screenshot also settles the interactivity question: this is a batch tool, not a loop
participant.

---

## 2. The architecture: three substrates, and never mix up which answers what

| Substrate | Answers | Never ask it |
|---|---|---|
| **Computed styles / CDP box model** | every question with a number in the answer — spacing, alignment, contrast against a solid backdrop, overflow, target size, token conformance, animation duration and easing | whether it looks good |
| **Accessibility tree** | semantic conformance, element identity, attribution back to source | anything perceptual — a perfectly valid a11y tree coexists with text overlap and occlusion |
| **Pixels (a frontier VLM)** | hierarchy, attention, "does this page make sense", contrast over a gradient, anything where the styles are right and the render is wrong | any number |

The governing rule, from A4 and confirmed by the bench: **the grounder supplies identity, the DOM
supplies geometry.** A model-produced bounding box is a 68-mAP estimate of something
`getBoundingClientRect()` returns exactly, for free, with no hallucination risk. Forbid the judge from
computing any distance from a box a model drew.

An agent using one substrate has a *silent* blind spot — it emits a confident clean report. That is
the most dangerous failure mode available to us and it is why the split is the architecture rather
than an optimisation.

### The seam, made explicit

The deterministic layer's most valuable output is not a finding, it is an **abstention**. On the
gradient-backdrop page it returns `contrast-indeterminate: cannot compute a ratio, backdrop is an
image/gradient — requirement 4.5:1 is UNVERIFIED for this text`, rather than a pass. Every silent
pass that should have been an abstention is a defect shipped. The abstention set is exactly the
vision layer's job queue, and it is small, which is what makes the vision spend affordable.

**Use `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot`, and do not let it delete that abstention.** A7 found the call
returns the compositor's own *blended* background colour per text run — the correct contrast operand,
which every JS ancestor-walk (including this bench's first version) merely approximates. Measured here:
**7.8 ms**, populated for 31 of 83 layout nodes, and it correctly resolves alpha and layered backdrops.
It is also 29× faster than the in-page `getComputedStyle` loop most tooling uses and 177× faster than
the per-node CDP walk, and the entire fact-pack serialises to ~854 tokens — *less than a screenshot*.
There is no context-budget argument for withholding facts from the judge.

But it samples **one** colour per text run, and on our gradient page it returned `rgb(30, 58, 138)` —
the gradient's leftmost stop:

| Sample point | Contrast vs white | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| left stop `#1E3A8A` — **what CDP reported** | **10.36:1** | PASS |
| mid `#3B82F6` | 3.68:1 | FAIL |
| right `#DBEAFE` — where the text actually sits | **1.22:1** | FAIL |

A nine-point swing across a single text run, and the scalar reports the passing end. **Adopting the
blended colour naively converts an honest `INDETERMINATE` into a confident false PASS, which is
strictly worse** — an abstention routes to the vision layer, a pass routes nowhere. This is the
fail-safe-default-mimics-the-healthy-state trap, and it would have been invisible: the rule gets
*better* on solid and layered backdrops at the same moment it goes blind on varying ones.

The rule that survives both findings: **take the blended colour, and keep the abstention whenever the
resolved backdrop chain contains a gradient or an image**, because no scalar can represent a backdrop
that varies across the element it sits on.

### The third layer: measure the DISAGREEMENT, not either side

A5's sharpest claim is that the high-value defects live in the *gap* between the two descriptions
rather than in either one, and that the cross-check is therefore the thing to build first — about 200
lines of NumPy, no model, no GPU. Built it (`bench/detect_xcheck.py`) and it holds. It is not a third
detector; it is a comparator that fires only where the DOM's claim and the rendered pixels disagree by
more than a stated tolerance, which means it needs no aesthetic judgement and no learned model.

The validated arm settles the gradient case that the scalar could not:

```
contrast-on-gradient
  [xcheck-contrast-varies] contrast is not one number across this text: 4.81:1 at
  the left edge and 1.57:1 at the right. Any single computed value is a fiction,
  and the right end is the one that fails a reader.
```

Sampling the backdrop separately in the left and right thirds turns "unrepresentable" into two
numbers and a verdict — no VLM call, no abstention, zero findings on the control. **That moves
contrast-over-a-gradient out of the vision layer's queue entirely.**

🚨 **The centroid arm was PROVISIONAL and shipped disabled**, because trying to validate it found two
defects in it, and both were instances of the exact failure this document warns about — a plausible
number nobody checked. (a) It compared ink to the element's **own** box, and `getBoundingClientRect`
returns the *post*-transform box, so a `translate` moved box and ink together and the measured offset
was **invariant under the very compensation it is supposed to verify**. (b) Its background was the
crop's modal colour, so on a round button the square crop's corners — page background outside the
circle — counted as ink and swamped a 16px glyph.

**Both are now fixed and the arm ships on** (`--no-x2` to disable). It is 1/1 on the corpus with zero
findings on the control, where before it was 0/1 with **two** false positives on the control and two
pages that were bit-identical in its output. What the fixing cost, and what it changed about the
arm's claim, is §2.1.

---

### 2.1 Fixing the centroid arm found a third defect, and it is the one that matters

Measuring against the container and masking to the painted shape are mechanical, and both hold: the
residual now moves by exactly the 2.00 px the corpus's compensation applies (control −0.33 px, variant
−2.33 px) where the two pages were previously indistinguishable, and masking the shape's own
antialiased rim — a near-symmetric ring that had been counted as ink — took the measured displacement
from 0.96 px back to the true 2.00 px and the ink from 189 px to 91 px, which is the glyph and nothing
else.

**The third defect is that there is no absolute zero on the vertical axis.** With both fixes in, the
control — correct by construction — still reads **+2.90 px vertically**, because where a glyph's ink
sits inside its line box is a fact about the font's baseline and ascent, not about any centring claim.
A threshold calling that a defect fires on a clean page, and fires differently on every machine. So
the arm measures the **horizontal axis only**, and says so.

Nor does a residual alone separate right from wrong, because **a mark that needs optical compensation
is one whose correct residual is non-zero**. The arm therefore splits on what the DOM declared:

| The DOM says | The pixels say | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| container centres this mark, child declares **no** compensation | ink is off-centre | **assert** — the DOM claims perfect centring and the render disagrees |
| container centres this mark, child **declares** a compensation | a residual survives it | **abstain** — whether that residual is the intended compensation or an error is a judgement about this glyph's shape |

That second row is not a hedge, it is the seam working. A detector that asserted there would be
inventing a threshold it has no basis for, and the corpus now carries a page (`optical-overshoot`,
7 px of translate against a ~2 px ink bias) whose *correct* answer is `INDETERMINATE` — so the
abstention is graded rather than assumed.

### 2.2 The gradient arm was silently wrong for the same reason, and only the control run found it

The validated X3 arm above reproduces on the machine it was written on and **not** on a Linux box with
different font metrics, where it fires on nothing at all. The cause is the same masking defect one
level along: it sampled each band's **modal** colour, and over a gradient no colour is modal. The most
common single value in the caption's left band turned out to be **the text's own white ink**, giving
1.00:1 against white text and a left/right delta too small to fire. It was sampling a real quantity
that was not the backdrop, and it had been read as a validated result.

The backdrop is now the per-channel **median of the pixels that are not close to the declared
foreground colour** — exact on a solid backdrop (the control's hero caption reads 5.49:1, matching the
authored blue-100-on-blue-700 exactly) and stable across a gradient (6.01:1 left, 1.90:1 right).

**The generalisable finding, which is the same one §1 recorded and did not finish acting on:** a
detector that scores correctly is not a detector that has been *checked*. Both arms produced a
plausible number from a wrong quantity, both were reported as working, and what caught them was
re-running against the control on a machine that renders differently. §8's false-positive budget is
now the thing that does this every time rather than by luck.

## 3. Local models: no

Not on quality, not on latency, and not on the analogy.

- **Quality.** The open entrant in *MLLM as a UI Judge* scored **53% on pairwise design preference —
  chance** — against 90–93% for frontier models on clear cases (arXiv 2510.08783). Chance-level design
  advice is actively misleading, not merely worse. Our own measurement above agrees: correct at one
  resolution out of three, confidently wrong at the other two.
- **Latency.** 21–66 s per screenshot, measured here.
- **Quantization.** Spatial and layout reasoning is the *most* quantization-sensitive class measured
  (8–15% loss at 4-bit; the projector is the worst bottleneck; arXiv 2607.08029). A uniform 4-bit
  checkpoint — which is what `mlx-community/*-4bit` gives you by default, and what we measured — is
  precisely the configuration to reject. The correct recipe is 4-bit LLM, ≥8-bit projector, 8-bit or
  fp16 vision tower, and on M1/M2 **fp16 not bf16**, because bf16 is software-emulated on this silicon.
- **The analogy fails on all four properties.** Local speech won because ASR is narrow, has crisp
  ground truth (WER), is high-volume, and is latency-sensitive — and because open 0.6–2.5B models
  literally top the leaderboard. Design critique is open-ended, has no ground truth, is low-volume,
  and tolerates seconds of latency. Nothing transfers.

**Where a local model would earn a place:** bulk anomaly *screening* over a large corpus of
screenshots where the cost of a cloud call per shot is the binding constraint and a 50% hit rate is
acceptable because a second pass adjudicates. We do not have that workload. If we ever do, the config
is `Qwen3.5-35B-A3B` (MoE, ~3B active, roughly 9× cheaper prefill) at ~1344 px, not a dense 27B.

---

## 4. Cloud: default to the vision we already have

The delta over Claude's own vision is narrow and not where intuition puts it. Four free levers come
before any new vendor:

1. **Pin the high-resolution tier and capture at ~2576 px long edge.** Claude 4.7+ ships a
   2576 px / 4,784-visual-token tier automatically; the old 1568 px guidance in our March corpus is
   stale. Opus 4.6 → 4.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro went 69.0% → 79.5% attributed mainly to accepting ~3.3×
   more pixels. **If our pipeline downsamples, we inherit the old score whatever model we buy.**
2. **Take localisation out of the model entirely** — the accessibility tree and `getBoundingClientRect`
   are exact and free.
3. **Crop and zoom rather than downscale.** ScreenSeekeR took OS-Atlas-7B from 18.9% → **48.1%** on
   ScreenSpot-Pro with no model change — a larger delta than every model upgrade combined.
4. **Run the deterministic layer first** so the model is only asked the residue.

Set `transformations: {"oversized_image": "error"}` so a silent resize becomes a 400 naming the exact
target size, rather than quietly destroying the evidence.

**The one genuine gap:** you cannot crop when the question is global — full-page rhythm, whole-frame
sharpness. Claude's high-res tier caps at ~3.75 MP, so a 3840×2160 retina capture loses ~55% of its
pixels. If that case matters, OpenAI's `detail: "original"` is the only documented no-downscale path.
Gemini is worth a call only where there is no accessibility tree at all — canvas, WebGL, PDF comps,
competitor screenshots.

---

## 5. Specialist CV: no, with exactly one exception

Frontier general VLMs have overtaken every open GUI specialist: Claude Opus 4.5 → 4.6 → 4.8 on
ScreenSpot-Pro ran 45.7% → 83.1% → 87.9%, against the best open specialist Holo2-235B at 70.6–78.5%.
Microsoft's own OmniParser successor states it "does **not** rely on separate models to parse the
screen." Scaffold half-life in this field is roughly 18 months. A specialist buys an *inventory*, not
*precision*.

**The exception is saliency, and it is principled rather than accidental.** On the same test set, same
metric, same images (UIGaze, arXiv 2604.26352): UI-trained **UMSI++ scores CC 0.833** against the best
frontier VLM at **CC 0.408** — GPT-5.4 0.408, Claude Opus 4.6 0.344, Gemini 3.1 Pro 0.144. The gap is
2× and the mechanism explains it: early gaze is *pre-semantic*, and a VLM reasons semantically. The
VLM even improves with longer simulated viewing (0.217 at 1 s → 0.408 at 7 s), which is exactly
backwards for the reflexive first second where hierarchy either works or does not.

So saliency is the one place a small specialist model beats everything hosted. Use it as **a second
image plus one decision-relevant statistic** — "the element you named primary captures 4% of predicted
attention mass; the largest mass, 31%, is on the hero image" — never as a score. Blocker: UEyes/UMSI++
weights carry **no license file**; that must be resolved before any non-personal use.

---

## 6. The benchmarks cannot decide this for us

This is the most consequential negative finding in the wave, because it invalidates the obvious way to
pick a model.

- **ScreenSpot-Pro contains zero web screenshots.** It is 1,581 instructions over 23 professional
  *desktop* applications — VSCode, Photoshop, AutoCAD, MATLAB. Every "SOTA on ScreenSpot-Pro" headline
  is evidence about CAD panels. *(This corrects A3, which treated it as the benchmark closest to our
  task; A4 read the benchmark's composition and is right.)*
- **Every ScreenSpot variant scores point-in-box, not IoU.** A prediction counts if a *point* lands
  inside the box. There is no box-quality term, so a model can score 96% with edges tens of pixels
  wrong. **No published number in this field certifies the property a design reviewer needs.**
- **The aggregators are unreliable.** llm-stats' board self-declares "0 verified results, 25
  self-reported". benchlm says Opus 4.6 scores 83.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro; Anthropic's own system card
  says 69.0%. Fourteen points apart. Read vendor system cards, never aggregators.
- **Judgement benchmarks say the judge is the weak link.** WebDevJudge: humans 84.82%, best models
  66.06%. WiserUI-Bench: frontier MLLMs barely above the 50% line, and order-invariant consistent
  accuracy **~30–37%** against a 25% chance baseline. Rubric scoring shows **16–39% top-1 ranking
  reversals from reordering alone**. Even a purpose-built fine-tune reaches 74.25% average but only
  44.30% consistent.
- **The web-specific number to use instead** is WebClick (1,639 real web screenshots): Holo1.5-7B
  90.24, UGround-7B 82.37, stock Qwen2.5-VL-7B 74.37, OmniParser v2 **40.7 at default thresholds**.

Corollary: **the corpus in `bench/` is not a nice-to-have.** It is the only instrument we have that
measures the thing we actually do.

---

## 7. What the June 2026 decision already settled

A13's audit found the answer to the biggest question was already on disk and had been lost.

The March 2026 corpus describes an architecture whose subject (`/preview/luxury-menu`), instrument
(`scripts/visual-validate.ts`, 1,974 lines) and central bet (autonomous VLM-judge quality gating to
85–90+) were all deleted or refuted by June — and not one of the four documents carries a staleness
banner. `docs/reference-images/` and `~/.claude/hooks/visual-preview.sh` were never built at all. The
`visual-design-iterator` agent *was* built, 568 lines, still on disk, and its first action curls a
route deleted on 2026-04-25 — a live-looking orphan.

Two June measurements outrank everything the March layer asserts:

- The pixel-VRT lane that "automation" actually shipped caught **0 of 6** real bugs prospectively.
  Regression-lock is not prospective detection.
- The campaign ratified: *"Do NOT run the heavy RE-DERIVE path (VLM 'is-it-great' gate / tournament …
  correlate with regression-to-the-mean; taste stays human, gates adjudicate correctness/coverage
  only."*

**That decision stands and this work does not reopen it.** The sanctioned role for the VLM is advisory
triage, never a CI gate. Everything in §2 is a correctness-and-coverage instrument; the taste question
stays with the operator.

The one thing the campaign promised and never produced is the north-star taste yardstick
(`DESIGN_PAGE_METHODOLOGY_PHASE1B_NORTHSTAR.md`, absent, no add-commit in `git log --all`). That gap is
still open.

Also corrected, because our budgets rest on them: the image-token formula is patch-based
`⌈w/28⌉ × ⌈h/28⌉`, not the `/750` in our docs; the API file limit is 10 MB, not 5; Claude models now
return absolute pixel coordinates, so "cannot localize" is stale.

---

## 8. What to build

Nothing in this list is a model purchase.

**Already built, in `bench/`** — keep and extend:
- `corpus/build_corpus.py` — 15-page ground-truth corpus (v1.1), `detectable_by` split, `expect`
  split, clean control.
- `capture.py` — screenshot + full layout/style snapshot in one browser pass, so a pixel finding and a
  DOM finding describe the same frame. sRGB pinned, LCD text off, reduced motion, fonts awaited.
  (`DR_CHROMIUM_PATH` names the browser where a pinned build and the installed Playwright disagree.)
- `detect_dom.py` — nine general design-lint rules with an explicit `INDETERMINATE` verdict.
- `detect_xcheck.py` — the DOM-vs-pixels comparator: zero-ink, optical-centre, contrast-varies.
- `route.py` + `weights.json` — the abstention router and the per-app rule weightings.
- `score.py` — the false-positive budget, as an exit code.
- `run.sh` — build → capture → detect → route → score, one command.
- `bench_local_vlm.py` — the resolution/latency sweep.

**How it reaches a session — a plain CLI, not an MCP server.** A11 checked the assumption and it was
wrong in our favour: an MCP tool *can* return image content to Claude Code. But image data is charged
against `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (default 25,000), and the `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars` escape hatch
explicitly "has no effect on tools that return image content" — so an MCP image tool has exactly one
lever, a session-global env var. A CLI that writes a JSON findings file and an annotated PNG, and lets
the agent `Read` the PNG, chooses its own output resolution and therefore stays inside the Read
ladder by construction. Fewer moving parts, and it is already the fleet's habit.

**Division of labour inside the perception layer**, from A5 and confirmed by the bench: **learned
models for semantics and grouping, classical CV for every number.** "Uneven spacing" is a claim about
a distribution of distances — connected components, sort, diff, histogram is the entire computation,
tens of milliseconds of NumPy on one core, and exact rather than probabilistic. A detector emitting
`{"label": "card", "score": 0.91}` has not started on the question. The decisive property is not mean
accuracy but the shape of failure: **classical CV fails by returning an obviously wrong number; a
learned model fails by returning a plausible one.** For a measurement layer feeding an agent that will
act on it, legible failure is worth more than a higher average. (The one place the gap runs the other
way: SAM's masks track rendered edges *better* than natural ones, because a rendered edge is a true
step function — but SAM is not semantic, so it will happily return a pixel-perfect mask of a gradient
band.)

**To add, in order:**
1. ✅ **The abstention router** — `bench/route.py`, built 2026-09-03. Deterministic pass first; its
   `INDETERMINATE` set plus the residue no rule has jurisdiction over become the VLM's queue, cropped
   to the region in question. Three properties the naive version does not have. It **collapses
   abstentions by class**, so two `contrast-indeterminate` findings on two lines of the same hero are
   one crop rather than two model calls. It **crops rather than downscales**, cutting from the densest
   capture on disk (§4 item 3: the same move took OS-Atlas-7B from 18.9% to 48.1%). And it **writes a
   block ledger** — anything a budget excludes is recorded with the reason, because a queue that
   silently truncates is a coverage claim that lies. Every crop carries the §2 prohibition in its own
   record: identity only, never a number. It never calls a model.
2. ✅ **A false-positive budget** — `bench/score.py`, built 2026-09-03. ~20% FP is where an AI reviewer
   loses credibility regardless of catch rate. It is a **gate, not a report**: non-zero exit when any
   rule asserts on the clean control (budget 0), when the FP rate over the defect pages exceeds
   `--fp-budget`, when a rule exists in the detector *source* but was never exercised by the corpus,
   or when a defect is neither asserted nor reachable by any queue lane. `./run.sh <profile>` runs the
   whole chain and returns that exit code, which is what makes "every rule added must be re-run
   against the clean control before it ships" a fact rather than a habit.

   Three design points worth keeping. **A false positive is computed, not listed:** a finding is false
   if it lands outside the injected CSS's blast radius, where the radius is the set of elements whose
   rect or computed styles differ from the control *plus their subtrees* — the subtree clause matters
   because putting a gradient on `.hero` leaves `.hero-title`'s every style byte-identical while
   changing what it is painted over, and without it the gate marks a correct finding false. **An
   abstention is not a false positive but it is a false *spend*:** the control gets its own abstention
   budget, because the affordability of this whole architecture rests on the abstention set staying
   small, and a model call on a page that is correct by construction can only come back saying nothing
   is wrong. **The gate has been run red in both directions** — a loosened contrast floor to force
   control assertions, a tightened centroid tolerance to force control abstentions — because a gate
   nobody has watched fail is not yet a gate.

   It immediately paid for itself: it refused the first green run because two cross-check arms had
   never been put in front of the control, which is how `invisible-text` and `optical-overshoot`
   joined the corpus (§1), and it is what caught §2.2.
3. **Order-randomised comparison.** If we ever compare two designs, permute over 3–5 orderings —
   that recovers about two-thirds of the benefit of ten, and exact balancing buys essentially nothing.
   Report discrimination spread and swap-consistency, never mean agreement.
4. **Motion, deterministically.** `getComputedTiming()` returns duration, easing, delay, iterations
   with `auto` resolved — "this transition is 400 ms and eases wrong" is an assert, not a vision task.
   Note the trap: CDP `Animation.setPlaybackRate(0)` controls WAAPI but not `requestAnimationFrame`,
   while Playwright's `page.clock` patches rAF but not the document timeline. A harness using one has
   a silent hole, and a GSAP page reports "0 animations found" as a false green.
5. **Saliency, second image only**, once the UMSI++ licence question is answered.

**Per-app, because they are three different problems:** `reso-landing-app` (Next 14, purchased
template) is largely a marketing-aesthetics problem; `reso-management-app` (Next 16, React 19,
Tailwind 4) is mostly design-system conformance, where the deterministic layer does nearly all the
work; `reso-web-app` (Next 13) sits between. One review harness, three different rule weightings.

✅ **Built 2026-09-03: `bench/weights.json`**, read by the router. Two things about its shape are
load-bearing.

**A weight governs attention, never truth.** It orders the queue and decides which residue is worth a
model call; nothing in the file can suppress a finding, and a `never_downweighted` set — contrast,
touch-target, overflow, zero-ink, contrast-varies — is clamped at 1.0 in every profile. The clamp
lives in the router rather than in a config validator, so a profile cannot acquire this defect by
being edited later. A WCAG failure is not less true on a landing page.

**The split follows the measured difference between the apps, not taste.** `reso-landing-app`'s design
system is *somebody else's*, so scoring it against our tokens measures the wrong thing — an off-scale
type step is how the template was sold. Conformance rules drop to a fraction (grid 0.25, token-drift
0.3, type-scale 0.4) and the budget moves to the lane that answers the actual question: 8 crops and
**3** blind gestalt passes. `reso-management-app` is ours end to end with a real token set, so a 6px
radius against an 8px token is a genuine defect with a file to fix it in; those rules sit *above*
parity (1.4–1.5) and the budget drops to 4 crops and **1** gestalt pass, because paying for judgement
passes over a dashboard whose every number the DOM already knows is the spend this architecture exists
to avoid. `reso-web-app` sits near parity and is **an honest placeholder** — nothing has been measured
on it, and it should be replaced by evidence rather than kept because it looks reasonable.

More than one gestalt pass is not redundancy. A single pass is a sample of one from a judge measured
at 16–39% top-1 ranking reversals from reordering alone (§6), so the lane a profile actually *relies*
on is sampled more than once and the spread is the signal.

## 9. What would change this answer

- A local model that clears ~70% on a DiffSpot-shaped eval at under 10 s per screenshot on this Mac.
- A published web-UI defect-localisation benchmark that scores IoU and false positives. None exists.
- A licence for UMSI++, which would move saliency from "promising" to "shippable".
- Evidence that our review bottleneck is *finding* problems rather than *acting* on them. A15's
  sharpest point is that this whole wave assumed perception was the constraint, and the most probable
  failure is a system that sees fine, critiques plausibly, and changes nothing.

## 10. Provenance

15 agent reports in `agents/` (A1–A15; A5 re-fired twice — see below). Bench code and raw results in
`bench/`, including `corpus/out/findings_dom.json`, `local_vlm_results.json` and `corpus/out/blind_key.json`.

**A note on the wave's own failure mode, which is a repo defect worth fixing.** The `deep-research`
agent type grants `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent, ToolSearch, Skill` — and **no
`Write`**. Our mandatory field-7 Delivery contract instructs every agent to write its findings to an
absolute path, so all fifteen had to satisfy it by streaming a 300-line markdown document through a
single Bash heredoc. Ten succeeded. A5 stalled mid-stream doing exactly that, its last words being
*"Write tool is disabled; creating the mandated file via heredoc instead."* The contract and the tool
grant are in conflict. **Fixed in this commit** (`Scope (grown): +repair the deep-research Delivery-
contract conflict`): `Write, Edit` added to `agents/deep-research.md`. That grant widens no
capability — the agent already had `Bash` and could always create files — it only replaces a fragile
channel with the first-class one. A contract an agent cannot satisfy with a proper tool is a contract
that fails under load, and it failed at 2/15.

Both stalled axes were re-fired on `general-purpose` with an explicit write-incrementally instruction
and delivered in full, so coverage is 15/15 with no axis dropped.

**On recovery generally, since it came up:** `/limit-recover`'s *audit principle* is the right
instinct for any cut-off subagent — disk-truth audit every slot, re-run anything not provably
complete, never accept a partial. Its *machinery* is not: it is built for a quota or login cliff and
recovers by transcript transplant to another account. A mid-stream API stall has no reset to wait for
and no account to move to. Audit with it; recover by re-firing.
