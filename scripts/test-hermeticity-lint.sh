# test-hermeticity-lint — a RATCHET on test-suite hermeticity.
#
# WHY: a bats suite that does not fixture $HOME runs its subject against the OPERATOR'S REAL state —
# ~/.claude/autonomy/idl.jsonl, ~/.reso ledgers, ~/.claude/mailbox. Two costs, both observed
# (2026-07-25 flaky-gate sweep): the suite MUTATES live state (404 stray idl.jsonl lines traced to
# one unfixtured suite), and it READS live state, so its result depends on whatever the desk happens
# to be doing — the textbook flake. $HOME is the single highest-leverage seam because nearly every
# tool in this repo resolves its state dir under it.
#
# WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A FLAG-DAY: 109 of 118 suites are unfixtured today. Fixing them all at once
# is a bigger change than anyone will review honestly, and a lint nobody can turn on is worth zero.
# So: the existing 109 are grandfathered by name, and the rule binds only where it is free — NEW
# suites. The list can only SHRINK. Fixing a suite is therefore a two-line change (fixture $HOME,
# delete its allowlist line) and the lint FAILS if you fixture one and forget to delete the line,
# which is what stops a ratchet from silently becoming a permanent exemption list.
#
# THE RULE: a suite is hermetic iff its setup() or setup_file() body sets a fixture HOME
# (`export HOME=` or `HOME="$BATS...`). Per-test HOME does not count — it leaves every OTHER test
# in the file pointed at live state, which is exactly the failure this catches.
#
# Exit: 0 = clean · 1 = violation · 2 = bad usage / unreadable scan dir (LOUD, never silent-green)
#
# Env seam (selftest only): CC_HERM_ALLOWLIST overrides the embedded allowlist.
set -uo pipefail
# Resolve $0 THROUGH symlinks before deriving ROOT. Everything under ~/.claude/scripts/ is a per-file
# symlink into this checkout, so a bare `dirname "$0"` yields ~/.claude — which has no tests/ — and the
# --selftest case that lints the real tree then fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the
# ratchet. Observed 2026-07-26 running the DEPLOYED path right after landing it. (No `readlink -f`:
# that is GNU-only and this box ships the BSD userland.)

# OWN-SCOPE (2026-07-27) — which violations may BLOCK, as distinct from which are REPORTED.
#
# WHY: the ratchet's rule is "do not ADD a leak". Enforcing it over the WHOLE tree makes every
# lander answerable for every other lander's suite, and because trunk is shared that is a
# FLEET-WIDE hard stop. Measured this session: a DOCS-ONLY land (one .md file) was refused by five
# leaking suites it does not touch — cc-close-attrib, claude-accounts-core, claude-kimi,
# completion-assert, fire-autonomy. The lander cannot fix what it did not break, so its only moves
# are "wait for someone else" or "fix five unrelated suites mid-land". One author's omission
# becomes everyone's outage; GATE_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN §9 measures the cost (66% -> 30% land rate).
#
# WHY IT IS NOW SAFE TO SCOPE. The original whole-tree fail-fast had a real premise: an unfixtured
# suite reads AND writes the operator's live ~/, contaminating every other result in the same run.
# Phase 2a (`d9b934ee`, per-gate $HOME isolation via APFS clonefile) removed that premise — the
# gate's bats children run under a CLONED $HOME, so a leak now dirties the clone, not the operator.
# That argument was load-bearing until 2a landed, and is not after. This change is therefore a
# COMPOSITION with 2a, not a weakening of the ratchet.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE: the full tree is still scanned and every violation still printed — a leak
# outside the set is LABELLED, never hidden, so "advisory" can never be misread as "clean". Only
# the EXIT CODE narrows. With no own-set the behaviour is byte-identical to before (every violation
# blocks), so --selftest, the postland net, and a bare human invocation are untouched. ship-land is
# the sole opt-in caller. Kill switch: SHIP_LAND_HERM_OWN_SCOPE=off restores whole-tree blocking.
# THREE states, not two — and `${VAR:-}` cannot express them, which is the bug this comment exists
# to prevent recurring. An own-set that is ABSENT means "strict, judge the whole tree" (postland, a
# bare human run). An own-set that is PRESENT BUT EMPTY means "this land changes no suite at all",
# so NOTHING may block — the docs-only land that motivated the fix. Collapsing them with `${3:-}`
# reinstates the exact hard stop being removed, silently and only for the docs-only case. Presence
# is therefore carried by ARGUMENT COUNT here and by `${CC_HERM_OWN+set}` at the entrypoint.
