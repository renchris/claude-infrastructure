# test-hermeticity-lint — a RATCHET on test-suite hermeticity.
#
# WHY: a bats suite that does not fixture $HOME runs its subject against the OPERATOR'S REAL state —
# ~/.claude/autonomy/idl.jsonl, ~/.reso ledgers, ~/.claude/mailbox. Two costs, both observed
# (2026-07-25 flaky-gate sweep): the suite MUTATES live state (404 stray idl.jsonl lines traced to
# one unfixtured suite), and it READS live state, so its result depends on whatever the desk happens
# to be doing — the textbook flake. $HOME is the single highest-leverage seam because nearly every
# tool in this repo resolves its state dir under it.
#
# WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A FLAG-DAY: 109 of 118 suites are unfixtured today. Fixing them all at once
# is a bigger change than anyone will review honestly, and a lint nobody can turn on is worth zero.
# So: the existing 109 are grandfathered by name, and the rule binds only where it is free — NEW
# suites. The list can only SHRINK. Fixing a suite is therefore a two-line change (fixture $HOME,
# delete its allowlist line) and the lint FAILS if you fixture one and forget to delete the line,
# which is what stops a ratchet from silently becoming a permanent exemption list.
#
# THE RULE: a suite is hermetic iff its setup() or setup_file() body sets a fixture HOME
# (`export HOME=` or `HOME="$BATS...`). Per-test HOME does not count — it leaves every OTHER test
# in the file pointed at live state, which is exactly the failure this catches.
#
# Exit: 0 = clean · 1 = violation · 2 = bad usage / unreadable scan dir (LOUD, never silent-green)
#
# Env seam (selftest only): CC_HERM_ALLOWLIST overrides the embedded allowlist.
